["Outstanding! And I am not a fan of buffets, because I do not believe that anything good in quality can be produced using mess production! Bacchanal is different. Went there out of curiosity . I find Caesars dining options, with exception of Hyakumi, excellent, so decided to check out Bacchanal! \nMost of the dishes I tried can be easily compared to high end restaurants food on  quality & taste. Duck, lamb chops, roasted chicken.. The list can go on and on. Seafood unfortunately was no different the anywhere else. Frozen, tasteless and very poor quality.     \nMy biggest complain would be the layout of place. It is impossible to walk without bumping into somebody.. Bad idea when you carry hot plates.\nOver all great place. I just wish it would stay this way. Unfortunately seeing what happen to Wynn, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan,etc. I give them 2-3 months until cost cuts will take place.", "Look, if you're reading this, you've already proven that you hold a degree in advanced eating techniques. Who reads up about buffets but people who enjoy eating? \n\nWith that said, there is a difference between people who want to gorge themselves with whatever they teeth may fall on, and those who want nothing but quality. \n\nThe latter people should continue reading from this point on. \n\nBacchanal Buffet has been the talk of the town for a bit now, and when it finally opened up on September 11, 2012, it did not fail to impress the masses. I actually got to enjoy it on its first Saturday at dinner. \n\nFirst, the line was long. But not as long as I have waited at the \"M\" buffet on a couple of occasions. It can only get better..or worse as word spreads about Bacchanal.\n\nSecond, the service. Let's get this out of the way now. It's week one, and it was a weak one. But I can only imagine it will right itself out with time, so no biggie there, and no stars lost.\n\nThird, the food. Come on... I don't have to tell you what to expect. Look at the photos. Look at the reviews. It says it all! Ok fine, I'll tell you the two things that totally blew my mind. First up, the crab. Wherever you go, you had a herd of people, that goes and triages through the freaking crab legs to grab the claws and nothing but the claws. Bunch of vultures discarding pieces to the side to find the elusive claw. And then they leave. With all the claws. What the f.....\n\nBUT Bacchanal fixes that problem and offers claws by themselves. That's right. BY THEMSELVES. But holdup! They are already pre cracked and take absolutely no effort to eat. \n\nThe second thing that blew my mind...crap I forgot, I ate everything and then fell into a food coma.\n\nThe end.", "The interior decor was beautiful. Food display was awesome. Selection was large. Taste and flavor were bland. Service was terrible.\n\nThe food lacked any depth or spazaz in flavor. Selection and quality were on par with the Rio. Fine but not great. Some dude was angry that the olive oil was mixed with Canola oil and was calling the chef out. \n\nNot sure why the great reviews....I feel like I'm that odd hater.... but having been to many buffets in Vegas, I won't be coming back. I expected so much more from Caesar's Palace! Especially after paying $40.\n\nI had to finally get a manager to get me help refilling my tea. I waited 40 min and asked twice for a refill. I felt like I was a starving man in a desert that had to fight for a taste of liquid. \n\nBLUF: Wicked Spoon is better. Haven't been to the Wynn to compare theirs yet.", "We arrived yesterday at 12:30pm for a Sunday brunch, waited one hour to get in. They have raised prices on weekend brunch and charged us $39.99 + tax each at 1:32pm. Get a player's card to take $3 off each person. Only after we sit down, we've found out we are ripped off. The crab claws, lamb chop, rainbow roll, mussels, clam baskets and many dinner items are missing until after 3:30pm.  The sushi are not fresh and the oysters are weak. The better food is the snow crab legs and the Ginseng chicken. We finished our brunch about two hours later but we were too full to test all the dinner food. My photos are all taken on the better food served after 3:30pm.\nPros:\nThey defrost the snow crab legs for each individual with hot water.\nOysters served after 3pm tastes fresh.\nThe Ginseng chicken soup is heavily loaded with good stuff. A must try.\nThe small sized deserts tastes good.\nCons:\nThe bbq pork ribs is tough and tastes terrible. The Chinese dim sum is mediocre. Hot and sour soup is thick and bland.\nThe server never return to refill our drinks and let the plates pile up. No tips!\nMany hot dishes do not have labels, making it hard to tell what cooked food you are getting.\nSome hot food is difficult to get to because pots and pans are put inches from the lights.\nWhat you see is not what you get. They claim to serve 500+ items at the front desk but I counted much less. There is a large Alaskan king crab at the display window but they serve only medium size snow crab legs.\nOverall:\nPrice:          1\nFood:          3 (Maybe a 4 if you find the real dinner food)\nService:      1\nAmbience: 4\n\nI wonder if many of the previous reviews are fake or if management at this restaurant has fallen off a cliff.", "beautifullll buffet. quality seafood, $$$.\n\nFEA$TED LIKE A BO$$.\n\nfyi...their desserts are out of this world. They have everythinggg! create your own crepe, macaroons, unique gelato flavors....i can talk my head off about this place but looking at how long all the other reviews are, i wil stop here.", "One of the Worst Buffets I've ever been to!  I've had better quality cuts at the Sizzler!\n\nService = Atrocious.  \n\nWe arrive with 10 people.  The hostess tells us that any group larger than 6 is an automatic 18% gratuity.  This is perfectly fine and is the standard for every restaurant I've dined at.  Servers should be tipped fairly; however, the restaurant MUST accommodate the large group by seating them together.  Otherwise it is two separate parties!  They seat 10 of us at two separate tables after charging the 18% gratuity.  We ask why this happens, and they send a manager to tell us that standard policy is to charge 18% for large parties.  But how can you separate the large group, yet still charge as a whole??  The manager explains that they can't properly accommodate seating 10 people together because of the limitations of the seating.  We're not going to argue over this.  It's absurd.\n\nThe layout of the buffet is awful.  They force you to walk down a circular maze of tiny corridors, which forces the customer to look at each item and deny it, without the possibility of getting an overview of where everything is.  You want seafood?  You can't just go to it.  You have to wait in this absurdly long line till everyone else at the buffet is finished getting all of  their portions.  This means that you end up waiting nearly 10-15 minutes if you wanted to get something at the end of the line (seafood), even if you didn't want anything from the beginning of the line!  \"Why not just cut in line,\" you ask!  Doing this would be asking for trouble because of the layout of the buffet.  It would literally be like cutting in front of someone who is waiting to get their food.  As upset as I was for attending this place, in no way would I take it out on other paying customers.  \n\nThe waitress made several errors on our drinks and kept laughing it off.  It was completely unprofessional.  Mistakes happen, and no one expects perfection.  But to screw up orders on several occasions and laugh it off is out of line.  The server actually stepped on my feet while reaching all the way over the table to fill someone's cup of soda.  Why not walk over to the other side and pour their drink?\n\n\nQuality of Food = POOR\n\nIt is obvious that the food has been left out for hours.  They boast and brag about 500 items on the menu, but the meats are not quality cuts.  Furthermore, they are prepared poorly.  I've had better quality at Commerce Casino in Compton!  \n\n\nGarbage Service \nGarbage Food Quality\nPoor Management\n\nSTAY AWAY!", "This was my second time doing the Buffet of Buffets pass this year http://www.caesars.com/total/las-vegas/buffet-of-buffets/ and I was excited to learn that Bacchanal was added to the list.\n\nWe knew there would probably be a wait for dinner and that it would cost an additional $15 per person beyond the pass price, but figured it was worth a try.\n\nWe went on a Sunday night and started waiting in line around 7:30pm, and didn't get in until 9pm...by which point we were starving. [Since they close at 10pm, it was also unclear as to whether we would really get in or not, but it didn't seem like they actually cut anyone off. The cashiers and servers were pleasant, although it took us a long time to get our drinks.]\n\nDespite the massive line and the 90-minute wait, there was a ton of empty tables, which makes me wonder if they're just understaffed/not able to handle the capacity of the restaurant.\n\nThe food was okay, nothing to write home about--the sushi looked gross and the selection was not as interesting as some of the other buffets. The most impressive part of it was probably the dessert spread (which we didn't try). I'm not sure what people think is so amazing about it besides the novelty factor.\n\nBut the first reason for the 1-star rating is that BOTH of us got sick right after eating there. The only two foods that we both had were the shrimp and the oysters, and we're guessing it's the latter that did it. The second reason for the rating is that we followed up with the restaurant the following morning to report our food poisoning. We started by calling Caesar's corporate customer service, and the lady I spoke with took a report and said she would get back to me in 24-48 hours. Not only did she not get back to me, when I called the same office to follow up after 48 hours, they said that no one there had any recollection of having spoken to me, and that food illnesses have to be reported to a different office anyway (their security department). So, I went through the process all over with them, and then THEY passed on my case to their insurance company (talk about making the customer jump through hoops). Then I had to follow up with insurance on the case--they would not call me. At no point in this process did any of the people I spoke with seem apologetic that we got food poisoning at their buffet, and instead seemed to question whether we really did get sick because of their food. (Which we absolutely did--we were both sick very soon after eating there and did not recover until the following day--totally ruining our plans to go out that night.) Finally, I get a sterile letter from the insurance company saying that Caesar's is in no way at fault for the situation, but that they still hope to see me back.\n\nAs if. \n\nI'm so disappointed with the complete lack of customer service that I don't want to patronize Caesar's again--for ANY of their buffets. It's not worth it spending money at a hotel that can't even apologize for getting their customers sick and ruining their vacation plans. The least they could have done was to refund our money for that meal, especially after all the time I had to spend on the phone with them.", "While we aren't Las Vegas Buffett experts, we've experienced our fair share of buffets.  Elaborate ones in fancy international hotels, Mother's Day spreads, ordinary/average ones, etc.  Not once..ONCE, have we experienced food poisoning (even the \"SEAFOOD\" buffet at the Rio-and we were so skeptical that we would get food poisoning there because of the seafood scenario-nope..we were fine)  That all changed here\n\nIf you've read other reviews about Bacchanal Buffet, or read a newspaper/internet article-you know this place is brand new, a lot of $$$ was put into the project, everything is presented nice, the food options have massive variety, and the style and substance were expected to be on the same wave-length.  \n\nThe girl I went with was also supposed to post a review-ONE STAR.  So, in this sea of 4 and 5 star summaries, there should be another ONE STAR review in the mix when filtered by date.\n\nAnyway, should we have avoided the Oysters? Probably.  Living in Seattle, Oysters can be consumed rather easily.  You always hear people say \"beware of shellfish at the buffet\", \"don't eat oysters at buffets\" \"try everything but the oysters\" \"you might want to be careful about eating oysters\".  However, this buffet had such a glowing reputation, the reviews we read before we went were all first class/5 star, we said \"you know what? We're going to eat oysters...they look good, they don't smell off, and we're hungry..real hungry\".  \n\nBIG MISTAKE..both of us were throwing up about an hour after the meal.  We can discuss all the other stuff we ate, but that's not really relevant.  The point of the matter is that the oysters (and shrimp, but those were cooked)   were had by both of us.  Simple connecting of dots.\n\nNow we can all say \"that's your fault for eating oysters..you knew the risk..stick to cook foods at a buffet..use your noodle..that's an isolated experience..1 star is kind of harsh, dontcha think?\" while those arguments can be made, it wasn't just the food poisoning scenario that factors into this rating, it was what happened after.\n\nThe next morning, she called Caesar's to complain, she talked to them for a little while, and it seemed as if the person on the other line was making notes of all that happened.  Why else would they tell her\"we'll get back to you within 48 hours\".  That makes too much sense...Oh..but what happened 48 hours later?  She called back, and was told there was no documentation of the original call..Can't make it up.  Not only that, but she was told that she needs to call their security department...they also thought we were making this story up, as if it was strictly about getting a refund..yeah, let's just make this elaborate scheme for $45..wake up\n\nWhat did the security department do? Apparently they passed it on to Caesar's insurance department.  She was told that she needed to call them back to follow-up, not the other way around..Hospitality folks!  She did call back, and again the story about us getting sick was questioned..\n\nEventually she got a letter explaining that Caesar's wasn't at fault..no \"we are sorry you had an unpleasant experience\"..nothing..\n\nI'm sure if you avoid the Oysters, you'll be fine..but gee whiz..atrocious customer service..we're not picky..we're not demanding..we just expect common courtesy/common sense/logic to be in the mix when something like this happens..and it didn't\n\n#endrant\n\nPS-Planet Hollywood's Buffet is pretty good, though..Paris' too!", "7 days in Vegas and I was here 4 times. 4 TIMES! With all the choices in Vegas, the frequency (and my newly expanded waistband) speak for itself.\n\nAfter some major jet lag the bf and I woke up at the ungodly hour of 7 am on Sunday and headed to Caesars to check out the brunch spread. No wait and $100.00 later  we were in. \n\nMimosas on the table immediately, mountains of crab legs, so many amazing choices I can't even remember them all. 2 hours of leisurely brunch and we didn't even make a dent in all of the options. Everything was delicious, hardly a dud in the bunch.\n\nWe ended up going to an additional breakfast and 2 lunches over the rest of the week, never with more than a 15 minute wait and always with friendly hellos from the cashiers and hostesses remembering us from the previous days. For me the brunch was the best with both breakfast and lunch options. However if you time it right on the weekdays you can definitely span both breakfast and lunch.\n\nAnother plus, every waiter/waitress encouraged us to stay as long as we wanted and to get our moneys worth. Usually I feel a bit rushed at buffets, but here it was the exact opposite. \n\nI was a Wicked Spoon freak before this trip. We went to the Wicked Spoon once and were so disappointed. It does not even compare to the Bacchanal on any level (food, service, setting, etc) But frankly many of the real, nice, sit down restaurants in don't even compare to this buffet!\n\nNot saying you need to go 4 times but you must go to Bacchanal at least once when you are in Vegas!", "Ok. So I was so pumped about this place that I went a second time and took my family that was visiting from hawai!! Sure, the wait was 2hours long, but I told them it was going to be WORTH IT. Yes, $37.00 was pushing it..... which was what we paid the last time we came, but I told them they'd get their moneys worth. \n\nWe finally get to the front where we pay for out entrance, and the lady said it was \"$44\"  automatically im thinking, HOLY CRAP WE WERE JUST HERE and the price was not 44. She said the price changed a few days ago. Well, they should have put up a sign or something, how was I to know that?! the 37.00 was still plastered all over the website! I figured FINE, we already waited 2 hours, we might as well.  I asked for a party of 8, and she said they couldnt do more than 4 per table!! I was in shock! I mean i knew that they were busy, but one of the tings I loved about this buffet when I was there the last time was the big huge round tables they had to accommodate large groups! Right then and there I asked to speak with a supervisor, and even she was rude.  She said, and i quote , \"Maam, you can clearly see were busy, we cant take big parties on one table.\" I told her Id be willing to wait, and she told me it was going to be \"Another 2 hours\" I was upset, so I just took it and said fine, give us 2 separate tables.\n\nSo we get to our table, and get this. they sit us near 4 EMPTY huge tables that seat a part of 8!!!!! I was LIVID. i went up to the front and told them about it and they said that they didnt have a server for the section, even though it was 2 feet away from us! \n\nOh, and it gets worse.... so we've already waited 2 hours in line right? Just the line alone to get to the food was ridiculous!!! I waited for 15 in just for crab legs..... when I went to the asian section to get the roasted duck that I wanted, it was COMPLETELY empty, and had to wait for that too.... and a lot of the stuff they used to have when I first went there was GONE.\n\nOverall, $44 for a buffet? Bad Service? Not enough food? Long waits? SOOOOO OVERRATED! I wont ever go back, I can get way better food for $44 and wayyy better service and not have to wait as long.  Wicked spoon at the  Cosmo is now my new Number 1!!!", "The good, the bad, and the tasty!\nThe good:\nAlmost everything to be honest! Usually when you goto a buffet there are hit or miss items. You always get the same/similar things like prime rib, mash taters, salad, etc. and sometimes you eat it all or you leave some because it wasn't sooooo awesome. Well let me tell you I ate every portion I brought back to my table! Mind you because of their serving style and my desire to leave room for dessert I didn't have any heaping portions. \nThe bad:\nOur service was horrible. Our table was covered in dishes and we only received one refill on drinks. And my husband will drink my drink if his isn't refilled!  So I was irritated AND thirsty :| \nThe tasty:\nOkay fresh squeezed OJ? Hell to the yes Yuuuum ramen was awesome, steamed king crab legs were cooked perfectly, and my favorite item out of everything was a carne asada taco on their home made flour tortillas!!! Holy hell I could have eaten those by themselves for dinner!!! \nTheir desserts were to die for as well :) I had a fresh made Nutella crepe with lots of berries and baklava gelato! Their macarons were not as good a manons buuuut those are hard to beat! I hope the price goes back down because I can't afford $46 a person :(", "I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday early with my family, my mother really wanted to try the new $17 million dollar Caesars Buffet. We go for lunch and the line was worse than Space Mountain at Disney. We see a sign for a $15 line pass. This by the way is the only dollar amount being marketed in the buffet area. This entire area is a giant fail by the marketing department. There are no prices listed for the buffet. There are no prices listed for the special 24 hour buffet pass. People are getting to the cashier, which at 1pm on a Saturday, there is only one cashier, one cashier - and they are walking away at the ridiculous prices! Caesars, put up marketing materials, tell us how much the buffet costs. I was at wicked spoon and they tell you everything before you stand in line. Tell us the $15 line pass is per person. Tell us that if you come back the next morning, you'll have to pay another $15 to not wait in the line after you've already spent $65 a person plus tax and tip. Well after complaining to the manager, we finally sat down for the buffet. I liked the buffet, the food was tasty. I didn't overeat or go overboard because I was saving my appetite for my birthday dinner. Well, a few hours later, I'm gambling at the Wynn and it hit me. I got really sick to my stomach. I did make it to my bday dinner before I had to leave and spend the rest of my trip and a few min before my flight out in the bathroom. Thanks Caesars Buffet!", "Wouldve given 5 stars if it werent so pricey! LoL but this buffet is the BOMB! We hv a rating list for buffets, and this is the only one that we rated the highest on our scale. Got there before 5pm and no line. But diff story when we were leaving.", "My wife heard so many raves about this damn place and dragged me here. You know what happens to your manhood if you don't obey.. So, we came.\nWe arrived around 2:30 on Friday nov 9th. There was no lines. That was a sign but we paid 68.00 for both and started our adventure. \nThe buffet selection was bad. The only good thing came out of this was around 3pm they started bringing out crab legs for dinner. We got to try some but the crabs were crap (way too salty and not edible)  also frozen. \nBottomline, overpriced over rated. I was very disturbed and will never come back.", "After hearing all the buzz about this place, I decided to check out what the hype is all about.  It was Sunday Brunch and we arrived around 1pm.  The line was loooooong but that was expected.  Once seated at the table, my husband and daughter decided to tackle the ONCE AGAIN LONG LINE at the meat carving station while I decided to tackle the shorter line at the seafood station since I was already starving at this point.   While chowing down on the SUPER SALTY crab legs, I wondered where my husband and daughter were since they still haven't sat down to eat with me.   It nearly took them 30 minutes standing in line at the meat carving station!!  By the time they joined me at the table, I was ready to sample the rest of the food.  I then walked all the way towards the back to the Asian section (by the way the flow of the buffet just doesn't make sense!) to maybe try some sushi or sashimi.   There weren't that many good sushi selections either that's all they has or they just don't replenish fast enough.   I decided to skip the Asian section and walk my way towards the front.  I wanted some cured meats and cheese, but yet again the Parmesan cheese was a whole big block -no shavings or pieces one would have easy access to.  I was looking around for a knife maybe I thought one had to shave the cheese off himself, but no tool was around!  I was really getting frustrated at this point, but I still decided not to give up and try the meat carving station.  I had wishful thinking that the line was going to be shorter this time than when my husband and daughter were here.  Needless to say, the line was not any faster but at this point this was my last resort the last station i want to try since they have Prime Rib - my favorite, so I patiently wait for my turn.  Finally I get Prime Rib with Au Jus on my plate and  FINALLY join my family at the table, to only find out they are ALREADY DONE EATING!  I don't blame them since I was gone for almost 30 minutes!!!   To top it all off, the Au Jus that soaked my Prime Rib was sooo salty that I could only eat 3 bites out of that meat!  I was enraged at this point that I didn't even care to try their desserts!    Not being able to eat at the same time with my family because of the ridiculously long lines at the food stations and to be fed salty dishes is just absurd!   All in all, Bachannal Buffet DOES NOT live up to the hype!   The food is so much better elsewhere!  You're better off going to The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmo or The Studio B Buffet at The M Resort.", "Go to Wicked Spoon!  Your wallet and palate will thank you for it.  $47 for very mediocre food.  Kids over 8 were the same price and it was brunch.  Nothing was spectacular.  The ingredients were average and didn't seem very fresh.\n\nTheir website gave us the bait and switch.  It said $41.99 for weekend brunch and champagne was included.  They charged us $47 and champagne was an extra $10.   I can't believe people wait in long lines for this crap!", "We met up with some friends who were also in Las Vegas on the Strip for Thanksgiving dinner.  Every place that we considered eating had lines of several hours, so we knew it was going to be a long wait wherever we went.  We decided on the new Bacchanal Buffet and did the \"tag team\" approach to the 4  1/2 hour wait in line.  This restaurant just recently opened and underwent a $17 million renovation.  Prices were $50 per adult, children over 8 years old are considered adults at Bacchanal.\n\nThe food was exceptional in most cuisine areas.  The turkey and Thanksgiving food was a little weak.  The seafood section, Asian section with full sushi area and meat carving stations were superb.  One of our favorite items believe it or not was the mini burgers.  They were about the side of a half dollar coin, and had a phenomenal taste.  No condiments needed.  The seafood was super fresh and with many different options available including Alaska crab legs.\n\nService was okay, but there had been hundreds of people through the restaurant by the time we ate around 7:30 pm.  They seem to not be very good at keeping the lines moving and had two \"specialty\" lines that took priority over the general line we were in.  To the left there was a line that for and additional $20 per person, you could pay and be seated in an hour.  To the right was the VIP line for guests and other people of self importance.  It was sad to see but also comical as well to watch how poorly and child-like grown adults behave when they don't get exactly what they want.  In this case, most were frustrated at the one hour wait time.  Poor people.....I mentioned our wait time was over 4 hours.  When we departed at 9:30 pm there were still people in line.  \n\nI would like to visit again on a non-holiday time and give them another chance.  However, if the line is as long as it was and the treatment of the general dining people is as poor as it was over Thanksgiving, we'll pass.", "If you eat here pay for the express pass. Or you could go to M Resort's buffet, not wait in the long line and not spend $70pp!", "2nd visit..& will be our last. It didn't take long for this buffet to experience the downfall of others, food & service have both gone way downhill!.\nFirst the food: many items were cold & tasted like they'd been out for awhile. Also, you know food is being prepared half-a*#'ed/cheap when everything is bland & way oversalted. & the buffet itself is still totally unorganized.\nService: had to keep asking for refills & for our plates to be cleared. Our server must've been having a bad day, he hardly spoke.\nIt didn't take long for them to raise the prices either. They should've concentrated on the quality of food rather than overcharging for this buffet.\nNot worth the price and the lines are a joke. I'll take Bellagio & Wicked Spoon over this place any day..", "I read a review below that you should go to the Wicked Spoon instead. GO TO THE WICKED SPOON INSTEAD.  Good, that should clear that up. \n  Look I don't mind dropping a $100 on a good meal, but when you start spending $50 a person, the food needs to be delicious and the dining needs to be an experience. So-so on the delicious and FAIL on the experience.  \n    So of their menu items were actually NOT good at all. I tried some of their BBQ at the carving station and it was dry to the point of being toast like. Furthermore I don't know who is responsible for keeping everything clean here, but they fail EPICALLY. The place is disgustingly dirty. \n     On top of that I got my water refilled once, and I basically had to stalk the server down TWICE in order to get it taken care of. Seriously this place is not worth this kind of money. Go to the wicked spoon at the Cosmo instead.", "This was kind of disappointing. The Chinese duck was always empty-I went back 3 times and just skin and bones were there. Also all of their roasted meat tasted smoked and that is not what I want. I loved the oyster shooters, the shiu mai and char siu was very good. $100 for 2. Then I splurged and bought Veuve Cliquot for $120 -only triple what I pay for at Costco. But after 1/2 a bottle, a bug was in my glass. I brought it to the manager who said it was still alive (but drunk) and brought me a whole new bottle. So I spent less for more champagne.", "Buffet-Restaurants haben fast alle Hotels in Las Vegas. Im teuren Vegas eine M\u00f6glichkeit, gut und g\u00fcnstig zu essen.

Nat\u00fcrlich war es f\u00fcr uns dann eine Freude, das hier \u00fcblich hohe Trinkgeld flie\u00dfen zu lassen.\nDie Tische stehen nicht zu nahe beieinander, so dass man durch den Nachbarn beim Gespr\u00e4ch nicht gest\u00f6rt wird. F\u00fcr die japanischen G\u00e4ste stehen auch Rundtische zur Verf\u00fcgung. Und man kann sich wirklich Zeit lassen, im Gegensatz zu \u00e0-la-carte Restaurants wird man hier nicht  wie so oft in den USA  mit dem letzten Bissen freundlich hinaus komplimentiert.\nDas Restaurant ist selbstverst\u00e4ndlich f\u00fcr jeden zug\u00e4nglich, nicht nur f\u00fcr Hotelg\u00e4ste. Und der Preis ist f\u00fcr alle gleich (und f\u00fcr alles, was man in sich hineinstopft): $ 21,99 + Tax = $ 23,77. Das sind bei heutigen Kursen ca. EUR 18 !! Hier passt der Begriff Schn\u00e4ppchen. \nFazit: Buffet-Essen in LV ist eine uneingeschr\u00e4nkte Empfehlung. Hier im Bacchanal stimmte einfach alles. Wenn alles stimmt und schmeckt sind f\u00fcnf Sterne angebracht.", "Negative 5 stars!\n\nMy family and I got in line around 3ish pm on Thanksgiving day.  There was a long line already and they told us the wait would be around 3 to 3.5hr.  That's not great but was expected (that's why we got in line early).  We figured we could still get in before 7.  Apparently the employees there MISCALCULATED the wait time!!!!\n\nThe line was moving along until around 5ish.  That's when they allowed the \"express\" ppl to cut in line.  Caesar Palace wanted to make extra bucks so they created an \"express\" line.  $20 per person in addition to the $50 price they already raised on Thanksgiving day.  We would've left if we knew the wait was this long.  But by the 2nd and 3rd hour, we thought we were almost there when we were pretty close to the cashier.  But that's where the real wait began.  We waited and waited and waited and we were not going to leave the line after the 3rd hour of waiting.  And it would sound ridiculous if we paid extra to get into the express line after waiting for that long.\n\nWhen I told one of the hostesses we waited SIX HOURS, she was shocked.  She said, she's been telling all her guests the wait was only 3 to 4 hours.  Couldn't the employee be more diligent and not made up a wait time?!?!?  And after 6 hours of waiting, they told us we would have to wait even MORE if we decided to sit together.  So we ended up splitting our party into two tables.  Yeap, after a 6-hour wait, my family was seated separately on Thanksgiving day.\n\nWith the long wait, I expected great food and service... Another big disappointment.\n\nFood: What happened to the macaroons they always advertised?  There were no crab claws.  The cocktail shrimps were soggy.  Even the sushi was gross.  We saw the sushi \"chef\" took pre-made sushi out from saran wrap.  That showed you how fresh the sushi was.  Everything was mediocre.  Definitely not worth $50 and the long wait.\n\nService: Not great.  One of the chairs was soaking wet (caused by previous customer?) when we got to our table.  Our waiter simply put a towel on top and told us to just sit on it.  Really?!??!?!  It would have soaked right thru the towel and to my jeans because the chair was so wet.  I had to switch out the chair myself because the waiter didn't even stay for more than a sec.  And he basically disappeared that night too....\n\nIn conclusion... never coming back to this place again!", "I would come back again if the wait is not 3 hours! \n\nWe came on Christmas Eve and was told the wait on the regular lines was 4 hours and express line was 2 hours with 20 bucks extra. Of course, we chose to wait at express. We thought our time was too precious and what's 20 bucks anyway? If we only knew! We saw the regular line was moving constantly while we're stuck at express. Why??? Because those stupid Caesars Palace's managers don't have management skills at all. The express line was combined with Seven Star and Diamond members--I have no idea what they are, maybe the ones who stay and gamble at Caesars a lot. They have the priority. So when any of those 2 members came, they cut our line and got prioritized. There were times when we're not moving for almost an hour! \nThe lady who was in front of us, said if she was in the regular line, she would be in front of a family who was moving closer and closer than we were. She would be so pissed if that family got in first than her LoL... \n\nAfter 3 hours and 15 minutes, 3 dramas, (protesting to the manager about super slow express line and people arguing because after you paid, they pooled you at one place and there's no arrangement at all---that's why I said earlier, stupid managers of Caesar's who looked confused and overwhelmed!), we finally got in. The ironic thing was, after all the wait, all we ate was chicken ginseng soup and porridge! \n\nThe desserts? Well, the crepes was no better than Paris (seriously Paris has the best crepes so far in buffet category), Other desserts was OK, nothing special, except one chocolate cheesecake, it's first time I ever had it, it's very good. \n\nAnd if you're not Oysters lover, I don't think 57.99/person buffet is worth it.", "This is the buffet of all buffets. You will never find one close to this in the Vegas or anywhere is the US because \n\n1. They shuck the oysters in front of you.\n2. They boil the king crab legroom in front of you.\n3. They have tomahawk ribeyes. One of these will set you back $90 at a steak house.\n4. Stone crab claws...that's crazy. They didn't have it when I went so I'm guessing it's only available on weekends.\n5. You get to build your own crepe.\n6. They have congee, pho, and ramen but don't eat the pho.  It is nasty. They need to hire the cook from Rio to make it.\n7. There are many more stuff that you won't find in other buffets.\n\nI took off 1 star for the long azz wait. If you come for dinner show up at lunch time. Bring a portable toilet, chair or sleeping bag...you will need it!  Or you can do what I do. Find a high roller and have them bring you in. The only bad part about it is you have to eat with them and hear all their bad beat stories...lol", "The quality of the food isnt worth the price. Wicked spoon had similar food that was better priced. This place was simply overpriced and had horrible service.\n\nNot worth the price. It's about $50 per person for dinner. The quality of the food rivals the wicked spoon buffet at the cosmopolitan but ive gotten better service at a ten dollar Chinese buffet in a strip mall. \n\nThe lines for the headline items can get pretty long if you hit the dinner rush. The prime rib, rib eye, and the Kobe sliders were way too salty. However the lamb was cooked and seasoned well. \n\nThe other big draw is the king crab legs. I hesitate to call the guy dunking the crab into boiling water a chef because he didn't know the difference between the king crab I asked him to steam from the snow crab legs he handed to me. Regardless his rude attitude prompted me to complain to the manager (my first time ever complaining at any restaurant...normally I just leave). \n\nBesides the lack of service and the rude staff, the food doesn't merit the price. Sure you can try to get your money's worth if you keep going back to the prime rib and king crab while avoiding fillers like the fries or fried rice, but there was nothing that stands out. \n\nThe desert selection was nice and had a friendly chef in the crepe station, as well as a nice Aztec chocolate gelato that was spicy for even a guy that asks for \"thai hot\".\n\nGiven a choice, I'd just go back to the wicked spoon rather than waste my time and money at bacchanal. The food is better, cheaper, and served without a scowl on the \"chef's\" face.", "Very disappointed!\n\nThe food was OK, not really any better than  Bellagio, Wynn, or Cosmopolitans Wicked Spoon in my opinion.\n\nThe low rating is for the wait times and setup of the buffet.  There was a two hour wait in line to get in.  We choose to do the express line for an extra $15 each.  Once inside the lines continued.\n\nTo get to the seafood or the meat selections you had to wait in 20-30 minute lines.  You would walk to other parts of the buffet and it would be empty.\n\nMany of the selections are on individual plates or in baskets, this makes it difficult to carry your food as the plates slide round.  It is also cumbersome when you have to wait in long lines for your food.  \n\nI also noticed while making a salad that the counters were so low that I could not get around the sneeze guard to get to toppings in the back without having to contort myself.  I am 5'9 so not overly tall.\n\nI noticed that people were filling multiple plates because the lines were so long that to go back for seconds you would have to wait in line all over again.\n\nCesar's really needs to rethink this $50 million dollar mess, until then, don't waste your time.", "The food is ok, not good, certainly not great. One must wait in a ridiculous line to pay, in another to be seated, another to eat seafood, then another to eat meat. You can pay an additional $15 to skip the first line (it's worth it). With the additional $15 the buffet is $65 + drinks. I recommend a person to make a reservation at Joes Stone Crab or Nobu (Hard Rock) and have great food served to them. Please also note that the meat and seafood lines are so long, people eat while in line, then lick their fingers and go back for more.", "We went there Jan 2,2013.  After a very long wait, almost two hours, we were seated. Then we realized we had more lines to wait in. 20 minutes every time we wanted seafood,  thirty for meat. There were four of us and rarely were we at our table together.  Food was not that great. Would not go back.", "Maybe that is the problem with high expectations...\n\nI've heard for a few months now how I had to try the Bacchanal Buffet and how it was the best in Vegas.  I understand the days fo the $9.99 buffet are over and I have no issue shelling out $40-$50 for a premium buffet...but when I do so, I expect premium food and service.\n\nHonestly, I didn't find the food to be spectacular, or at least enough so to make me forget about the horrible service.  There were many items I enjoyed throughout my many samplings.  Overall, I was just perplexed at time by the set up and extremely frustrated by the service.  Maybe someone can help me with this one.  You have a long line building for crab legs (rightfully so) but why put the drawn butter at the beginning of the line...with no cups or other dishes to hold said butter.  Should i just lather it on an empty plate?  Upon further review, perhaps the crab legs should have been the START of the line and the butter the end...this would also explain why lemons, tartar sauce, horseradish and cocktail sauce were AFTER the chilled shrimp.  If this is the case, then why isn't there someone directing traffic?  I mean it wouldn't hurt to have people using the buffet the way it was designed instead of lining up the wrong way and getting in the way of the staff trying to go in and out of the kitchen and dodging swinging doors and carts.  The lines were going completely backwards.  You'd expect a place dubbed as the best to operate like a well oiled machine.\n\nAnother perplexing thing is how the line to get in is so incredibly long to get in but then inside the place is half empty and seemingly understaffed.  I'm looking around at waiters standing around, managers setting tables, dirty tables, and I can't get a drink order filled.  Our original waitress disappeared for awhile after serving us initially before I spotted her standing around doing nothing in another section.  I asked two different people and waited roughly 20 minutes for a drink towards the tail end of the meal before we decided to get up and leave.  This was all after we sat around for 10 minutes before a waitress even came by to take the first drink order.  Two beverages in 60+ minutes and nobody walking around filling up waters seems a bit unacceptable.  In addition, nobody came by to clear used dishes and glasses until we were almost forced to turn around and put them on an empty table just to make room.  I mean this seems like Buffet 101 type stuff to me...when people get up to get another plate, you clear the previous plate and/or bring a drink.  I don't know if we caught them at a bad day/time but $52 and a 30 minute wait is a bit too steep for me to run back and find out, especially with other good options down the street.  When comparing to Wicked Spoon in terms of price, food, and service, I would choose Wicked Spoon every time.", "We went there on Wednesday night at 6pm.  The line has already built up but couldn't believe waited 3 hours to get to the cashier.  After paid, still needed to wait another 20mins to be seated. \nUnbelievable.\n\nOnce inside the lines continued.  You had to wait in a 30 minute line for the meat section.  By the time we got back to the table and eat, the food was cold!  The seafood line was even worst.  The line was hold up because people were waiting for the staff to open the oysters from the shells.  Horrible experience!  End up eating salad and pizza for a $50 buffet!!!\n\n I would definitely NOT come back!!!", "Not sure if this place is worth the 3 hour wait.  The lines will probably die down once the buffet isn't as new any more.  But once you get in, you'll be overwhelmed by the amount of food options to choose from.  It's like the Buffet @ Wynn or Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo but 2-3x larger.  There's Asian, Mexican, Meats (American?),  and Seafood sections to cater to everyone's needs.  In addition, there's freshly squeezed oj, cucumber, and tropical (mango, pineapple) juice near the seafood section which is near the front.", "Price was actually 59$ per person when i was there around christmas time. but i thought it was worth it, only worse part of the meal was the mexican food. I also killed the desserts!", "I will not give this place -1 star because of the small plastic spoons for dessert.\n\n7 million dollar buffet? Caesars I salute you.\n\nBacchanal separates themselves with various mini containers of food. For example mini steak and eggs in a mini skillet. These little treasures are not only tasty but all wrap up in a little portion so you don't over eat.\n\nHighlights:\nShrimp and grits\nCrab\nPrime Rib\nShrimp\nGelato- Thai Tea, Fig Balsamic, and Brown Ale.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go early around 9am. No wait, when I left(4 hours later) the line was crazy.", "**You can pay $20 to skip the first line (which is the longest line)\n\n\nGoing to have to give this place four stars because it was line after line after line. \n\n& from someone who actually enjoys waiting in long lines, the lines here were a tad much. So there's the initial line to pay. Then another line to be seated. Then a million other lines to get food. Major buzzkill. Oh, but there are people walking around selling water bottles for $1 as you wait so no need to worry about dying of thirst.\n\nIf the lines weren't in the picture, this buffet is about as good as it gets in terms of selection. & I have tried all the other buffets in Vegas. The seafood and dessert sections in particular are awesome.\n\nThe layout is slightly odd as there is a whole section that you can miss thinking there's nothing there if you aren't seated in the back (as I wasn't) or if you don't wander (which I do). Though this section is mostly salads and what not, so you won't miss too much if you don't see it, but do wander as much as possible around the restaurant.", "This buffet is full of HYPE. I would rather go to Wicked Spoon and spend less $$$ and eat better food, hands down. My boyfriend and I waited an hour and a half JUST TO PAY then had to wait 45 more minutes TO GET SEATED. On top of that, there was a 25 minute line JUST TO GET FOOD. WOW, really?! I was getting so annoyed because the line was up to  the \"make your own\" taco section and the seafood was on the other end of it basically. It made me not want to get up and wait for more food because I didn't wanna keep waiting in that line. I am sooo disappointed with this buffet. I really wanted to like it since I LOVED Wicked Spoon and this was proclaimed \"The Best Buffet in Vegas.\" I think they should re-analyze that and consider everything else. The buffet was so packed and the buffet itself was so dirty. Food on the floor, no serving spoons on some dishes which made other people use a spoon they weren't supposed to which cross-contaminates the dish. The sushi is very low quality. The presentation of it is very mediocre. This was the first and only time I will ever eat here again. If you're debating whether or not you want to go to Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal Buffet next time you're in Vegas, I suggest going to Wicked Spoon instead. Going here is like a waiting game. You have to wait for everything which defeats the purpose of a buffet -_-\n\n$50 per person on a Saturday night.", "I was kind of disappoint may be because I had too much expectation for this place. Went there on a Friday night, wait for about 20 mins. \n\nService was 4 stars\n\nBut Food worth no more than 3 stars.\nKing crabs were fine like any buffets in Vegas.\nThey do have seafood paella, but its lack of flavor and dry.\nChinese dim sum disappointed me.\n\nThe crepe with ice cream was good \nThey had japanese ramen which is unique to other buffet.\noyster shooter was not bad.\n\nOverall, I'll be still going back to Wicked spoon instead of bacchanal", "All show and no go,  snow crab other then king crab,  Italian station and Mexico syations tasted very salty, waited 20 min to get in, counted 25 empty tables,  deserts tasted weak, would not go back", "HMMMM, changes being made here as Ceasars tries to figure out how to make money at this buffet.  First off prices have gone up!  Dinner is $46.95 mon-thur and $54.95 fri-sun.  You can still buy a 24 hour buffet pass but it is no longer worthwhile if you intend to use it on Bacchanal.  The pass is $55 plus $25 extra EVERY time you eat at Bacchanal whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner.  In effect it is cheaper just to pay the regular price if you intend to eat at Bacchanal more than once.\n\nPortion size has also been changed for a few items, the lobster corn chowder is in a smaller ramakin and no longer contains large pieces of lobster.\n\nThe made to order souffles are no longer in a ramakin and are being baked in foil cups, leading to the soufflies being over cooked.\n\nThe changes being made are sort of alarming as it makes you wonder if Caesar's will be able to continue this fabulous buffet or will quality suffer down the road.", "This buffet was a big disappointment! I paid ~$40/person for lunch including 18% tips mandatory for having 6 people or more. There was no crabs! no lobsters! The clams were not satisfying since they make you eat it with corns, potatoes, veggies...What a rip-off!", "Ate here soon after they opened. With two children, waiting over two hours was a pain. However, we soon found that by paying an extra bit of money, we could cut in line- and we did. Service was great, and the food was AMAZING.\n\nUnlike other buffets, where some dishes are disgusting and simply discarded- we ate everything on our plates! We can't wait to go back!", "The food is good, but the wait time is ridiculous. We waited for two hours, so to make up for the wait, we ate for about two hours!", "This place is pretty neat. DEFINITELY go at lunch time though. The pricing is a bit high for what you get in my experience(3 times). Lunch is best price per food selection. I found the hype to be a bit much with this place. They do have a few unique dishes you dont see at other places but they are seriously lacking in what I consider most important at a buffet.\n\nFoods: \nThey have virtually zero fruit. Only two small bowls of pineapple and watermelon hidden by the meats and then a few berries in the dessert section. The salad section is an absolute joke. It consists of 2 types of lettuce and about 4 types of toppings and a few dressings. This should be unacceptable to any normal human considering about 50-75% of our diet should be vegetables and fruits. I was extremely disappointed.\n\nService:\nIt took about 45 mins to get in which was sort of expected. Once we were inside however there were many many open tables so it didnt make sense. Next it took 11 mins before a server came to take our drink order. It was nearly another 10 mins before she returned with the beverages. We had 6 people at our table and we just ordered waters and iced teas. Now each person made 3-4 trips to the buffet and at any one time there were at least 5 dirty plates on our table. Our server litterally only clear the table twice but never got Everything. This is how our table looked much of the time. http://bit.ly/Y5TCXN\n\nOverall the buffet is slightly over priced comparatively to most big name casino buffets. The food is tasty but seriously lacking in areas that are VERY important to a human diet. I say Skip it.", "I tried coming to Bacchanal Buffet the weekend before Christmas. To be exact, we tried dining here on 12/22/12 on Saturday night. I assumed not many people were going to be in vegas during Christmas weekend so hoped that I wouldn't encounter super long wait for Bacchanal Buffet but boy I was wrong. Our party arrived around 7pm and there was a longgggg line that snaked around the restaurant.\n\nWe were in line for about 20 minutes and our line was right next to people that were in front of the line so I asked the girl how long she waited in line for. She responded, \"3 hours but we were started the line at an earlier point than you guys.\" WHAT!?!?!?! Within a minute of discussion, we decide to leave Bacchanal buffet and come by next morning for their brunch.\n\nSince we learned our lesson yesterday, we woke up super early on Sunday to be at Bacchanal by 7 or 730am. There was pretty much no line and we got in immediately but I left the buffet with disappointment. I know the brunch and dinner menus are usually different but the menu was SIGNIFICANTLY different. In yelp photos, I've seen all these multi-cultural food from pasta, tacos, mexican corn, prime rib and all these other foods but there were hardly anything I was looking forward to. I pretty much ate the regular breakfast food like potatoes, eggs, some pastries, and the only exciting thing there was pho/ramen/porridge section. :/ But Bacchanal is super clean and it looks fancy. There's miniature everything like mini jam, mini honey, and what not you can freely use. Brownie pts for that.\n\nI would like to try Bacchanal buffet during their dinner hour but I don't know about the 3+ hr wait. At this point in time, I totally prefer Wicked Spoon at Cosmo in a heartbeat.", "This place gets two stars ONLY because the food was decent and the best thing were the desserts. \n\nADVICE: Do not go if the line is really long. You'll wait on line about an hour just to pay to get in and then wait ANOTHER 20-30 minutes for the carving and seafood stations. This is true ESPECIALLY on holiday weekends. \n\nThe above advice comes from first hand experience and in talking with the servers. I wish I knew this before hand but it was so hyped up that it was like a must see like the water show in front of the Bellagio! \n\nIt was pure chaos in the dining room and I even saw a verbal confrontation when some people tried to cut in for seafood. The seafood line blended/meshed with the carving station, no one knew what was what and NO manager was on site to help. A simple roped off line would of even helped. The way this place is organized is just a mess simply put. Did I mention what a mess this place was? I think you get the message. \n\nGo when it's quiet and go somewhere else when this place is busy. Not worth the heartache (or heartburn).", "After reading several reviews of Caesars' new Bacchanal Buffet, I was excited to give it a try, but was tremendously disappointed. \n\nFirst, the service. Our wait in the \"regular\" line at 11:30 this morning was around 30 minutes. Normally, I'd have no problem with that, but when we did pay and were shown to our table, I noticed that only about 1/3 of the tables were full. Other reviewers have pointed this same phenomenon out, so I can only conclude that CP is trying to make their high-rollers feel more \"special\", or that they'd like people to pony up the extra $15 to jump the line, or that, if all tables were full, the chefs at the food stations would be unable to keep up. \n\nAbout that table: it was either too high, or my chair was too low. I still can't decide which, but either way, it was uncomfortable. My chair also straddled a carpet/ marble divide, with the back legs on marble and the front on carpet  not a big deal at a normal restaurant, but at a buffet, this wasn't ideal. \n\nI would, in fact, like to meet the idiot that designed the room. First, it's a clear rip-off of the design at Aria's buffet. (I did enjoy the light fixtures on the pillars outside the buffet). Second, the layout was confusing and somewhat claustrophobic, with the Asian area tucked into an odd dead-end. The stations where food was being prepared to order forced the lines of people waiting to block other areas. And the sneeze-guards were way too low, making it nearly impossible to reach food towards the rear. \n\nOn to the food: there isn't much special here that can't be found at Aria, Wicked Spoon, or Wynn (my favorite). The carved meats looked rather greasy, and the whole roasted chickens were shriveled and pathetic-looking. The sushi selection was decent, but if you're a shellfish lover, you're better off at the Aria or perhaps the Bellagio. The Mexican station was unstaffed--I'd been looking forward to a fresh-made tortilla, but oh well. The quality overall was good, but not great, and certainly not worthy of the price they're asking. \n\nWe ended up leaving after one plate--it was that bad. I expressed my displeasure to manager type on my way out, but she could barely say \"I'm sorry\". If you're looking for a great buffet on the strip, and willing to pay these prices, head for the Wynn, Aria, or Wicked Spoon--but avoid the Bacchanal.", "Worst food I have experienced on my trip to Vegas. Our server never came to our table, the bus boy was nice about getting refills, for the price not worth it.", "The food was great except when I was eating the oyster i found a live baby worm in it. So. Grossss!!! Totally lost my appetite. Plus the service was horrible. I asked the ice cream lady for a mochi. She dropped it on top of the counter but stil decided to put it on my plate instead of getting a new one.", "I have been here for my Easter Dinner with my hubby drove over 7 + hours but end up very disappointed. We spend $60/person for this buffet, we come here for their seafood station, but we found that the oyster is so skinny & the crab leg is smaller then my pinky finger. Compare with Makino Seafood Buffet in Vegas or Irvine, their oyster & crab leg even better than here!!!  I won't come back again.  It's not worth the price they are charging!!!", "It is ok for what it is. I was just disappointed by all the hype. It was not worth the price of admission. They do serve some specialties that other buffets don't serve.", "I don't mind paying $50 for a 5 star buffet but this wasn't what I expected. \n\nFirst of all I found someone else's used straw on the chair they seated me at. They did not acknowledge it and I refused to touch it when my hostess should have checked the table entirely. I ordered a ginger ale and they obviously ran out of syrup from the machine or the bar so it only tasted of club soda. I put the napkin on my lap and I saw a spot of DIRT, yes dirt on my napkin and I was about to wipe it onto my mouth. \n\nThe soup dumplings were sitting in their container for so long the gyoza soaked up what was left of the soup. I really hated the small trays that held one small item of food that was too hot to carry and too big to put on your plate for the rest of the food. The oysters on a half shell weren't their freshest. They can at least put some flavoring in it I.e. green onions, hot sauce, or salsa. The shells were not rinsed well enough. \n\nI wanted to complain to the manager and explain the fact that their quality control needs to be at their best because of the price that we paid for but I don't want to go back even if they offered a discount on my next visit.\n\nI can not fathom Bacchanal is not #1 because of the poor service and forgettable bites. However I do back up the fact that their desserts are amazing. \n\nI feel that paid a large amount of money to google for advertising because the experience was not great. I think we're going back to Wicked Spoon.", "im sorry---THE BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS HANDS DOWN....the prime rib at dinner, the seafood, the asian ribs and sui pork is to DIE FOR...the only bad thing i can say about it is ... the sushi selection was sad....maybe 5 different sushi selections and no sashimi ....was weird...but everything else was F**ING AMAZING...WELL WORTH THE 55.00 PRICETAG", "Skip & go to Wicked Spoon or Studio B Buffet. If you're into desserts then by all means, go to Bacchanal BUT if you want good, tasty & hot food - then don't go here. I was disappointed. Food was lukewarm & mind you, I got it from the tray that was just refilled. Crab legs were dumped in hot water but that didn't do it for me. Imagine cold crab legs dumped quickly in hot water... what do you get? Lukewarm crab outside with cold crabmeat.", "Honestly this place is overhyped.  Dinner prices have gone up to about $50 on the weekend.  It was worth about $30.  The wait was about 1.5 hours on a Saturday night at 8:30 PM...  We got in and then on my second trip they started shutting down the stations.  WTF!  No oysters worth eating (they put out leftover mini oysters...)  The crab legs were older and the chef \"refreshed\" them by dumping them in hot water and then serving them to us with all sorts of leftover pieces of crab meat hanging all over the crab legs.  HOW APPETIZING!  There is a lot of variety here that is for sure, but nothing really tastes amazing.  Wicked spoon is still the king of the Las Vegas strip buffets.    The prime rib was good and so was the mac and cheese.  I honestly don't remember much else.  Unless I get comped, I won't be coming back here.", "Pricey but worth it. They have less fruits and not so good for vegetarians.", "The prices in the first pic are inaccurate.  It's actually 49.99 per person.  Now, after eating a $250 dinner for two last night, I thought that this buffet would be a super deal.  Wrong.\n\nFirst off, the lines are ridiculous.  There's a line to pay.  Then there's a line to get seated.  Then there's a line for the buffet itself.  Anything else?  Oh, yes, line for the bathroom.  For a buffet that holds 600+ eaters, 5 stalls in the womens' bathroom is hardly adequate.  Don't get excited, men,  two stalls and three urinals.\n\nThis buffet is set up all wrong.  It's a HUGE space, but they have all the food on one side of the room.  Therefore, it creates a long and time consuming line to get any sort of food. \n\nThen comes the timing issue.  Since you're standing in said food line for a good 20 minutes, all of the food you got in the beginning of the line is already cold.  Mexican rice?  Cold.  Mashed potatoes?  Cold.  Baby carrots?  All cold.  I don't know anyone that prefers room temperature soup and cold fried chicken.\n\nWhile I can appreciate that they want to make a nice presentation, they have lots of dishes on small plates or in small baskets.  I'm in a buffet line, trying to juggle two small plates with samplings, a small basket of fried chicken, and a regular sized plate.  I REFUSE to get out of line to put anything down.\n\nThe food quality is not all that great either.  The fried chicken was tasty, but not crispy.  Mexican rice didn't have enough flavor.  Everything was just, \"meh\".  The chicken sausage had a strange flavor.  Brisket was good, but was a tad on the dry side.  They did have a crepe station, which I was very excited for - but they only had raspberries and bananas for topping (plus some nuts and chocolate).  No strawberries.\n\nI guess we were there around closing time, because I heard two of the waiters arguing about the hostess seating more tables.  Then one of them goes to the table of 5 that had just been seated next to us, \"The buffet closes in 30 minutes\".  WTF?!?!  So RUDE, and definitely NOT enough time to eat your $51 worth of food.  \n\nWicked Spoon is my first choice of buffet in Vegas.  I'll never do Bacchanal again.", "Quality:   3.5.  Selection:  4.  Value: 0.  Overall:  2.5.   Went the Sunday before Memorial Day.  Encountered a long line.  Decided to pay $20 extra per person to move up in line.  Dinner price was $60.95 each.  So, I paid $80.95 per person.  There was a display case in the front with lobsters.  After being seated, I looked for the lobster.  NO LOBSTER I WAS TOLD.  What the hell.  Looked for other options.\n\nGreat:\nLamp chops\nBurger sliders\nAsada tacos\n\n\nDisappointing:\nCrab \nPrime rib\nSushi\nSalad bar\n\nThis buffet is worth maybe $30 to $40.  Pay $60+ and no alcohol.  Not again.", "Why do pay an extra 15$ to be seated in a timely fashion?  The food was good but not worth the hype as usual in Vegas. I don't care about desserts I want  seafood the crab was good not great.", "So upon conferring with the wifey it appears as though I got my figures turned around as to the cost of the buffet. The buffet, if you DO NOT have a 24 hour wrist band, is $50/person. If you have the 24 hour wristband, which runs a penny shy of $50/person, the Bacchanal buffet is an additional $25 for dinner. So we technically paid $75/person to eat here but part of those funds paid for our breakfast the other two mornings. Still not worth it in my humble opinion.", "They are rude and unhelpful... Food tho good is very overpriced even for vegas def needs to be skipped", "*In cranky old person voice* - Buffets nowadays are getting more and more high-falutin', charging more and more for food that we can only look at longingly when our guts are full to the point of poppin!!\n\nFact - The d\u00e9cor at Bacchanal is equal to that of Michelin-starred restaurants, a setting in which overpaying for your food seems to make sense.  There is no question this place is beautiful.\nFact - The bounty is plentiful.  This is the stuff that could trigger sensory overload...think Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory but with more than just candy.  \nFact - Their dim sum is better than most regular Chinese dim sum places I've been to in Orange County.  Sad to say but it's true!\n\nUnfortunately, the ultimate fact is...unless, you're some type of competitive eater (or secretly employ the use of a vomitorium like they used to do in the olden Bacchanal days), you're only eating 1/3 of what you're paying for the buffet.  Everything else is going to the cost of d\u00e9cor and excess food.  \"Getting your money's worth\" is a purely subjective mission here.\n\nAs beautiful as the rest of the place was, hubby and I got shoved into what appeared to be an overflow room where our chairs didn't match and our table was no better than a two top in a French caf\u00e9.\n\nFood was plentiful as I mentioned and nothing really stood out. It was definitely a shock and awe type feeling.\n\nMy biggest issue with this place was the service.  Our server was ok, not super attentive so we didn't get refills unless we craned our necks to flag him down.  The biggest offender, however, was the surly possibly racist jerk at the carving station.  I witnessed him being openly rude to a meek lady with limited English skills and then suddenly offering the next few Caucasian people the biggest brightest smiles and an almost subservient tone of voice.  When it was my turn, I was once again shocked at his brusqueness and his rude tone of voice.  I smiled/chuckled and asked him if he actually gave away the entire ribeye to which his reply was an icy glare accompanied with \"No, you can't have the whole steak.\" I ended up with the worst, fattiest cut he could scrounge up for me.  My next visit to his station was wordless even when I attempted some banter.  I'm typically a \"live and let live\" type of person but if I ever run into this guy again, I believe will call him out on his rudeness.  A subsequent courtesy email to Caesar's customer service received no response.\n\nAs other Yelpers have noted, it's more expensive than typical buffets out there.  It just depends on whether you think you're willing to pay for d\u00e9cor and maybe slightly better tasting food.  I'm still down with Wicked Spoon....", "Over rated and over priced! Totally not worth any wait or the $$$$\n\nWhen it come to buffets... I am not a rookie; just FYI\n\nSorry Bacchanal, I really want to LOVE you, and I am so sad that I did not fall for you.  \n\nThe buffet is really pricey, even during brunch.  I am am spending about $110 for two, I expect the crab legs not to have ice all over and NOT looking dirty (Wynn The Buffet offer the best crab legs). The Asian food were weak. The sushi wasn't appetizing AT ALL and did not have many fish options; I had some and didn't care for it after two piece. The ramen soup was a waste of calories (I didn't finish the small bowl-- thank goodness).\n\nTheir dessert bar absolutely did not impress me. In fact, I didn't even bother getting anything there--- and that NEVER happens for me. \n\nTheir meat line was long and I am guessing this place is more for carnivores.  I didn't eat any meat because I hit buffets to eat seafood to get my money worth.  So I can't bash this place for their meat buffet.\n\nVegas buffets are like politics.  Everyone has their own favorite and you can't change their minds.", "Way Overpriced and Way Overrated!\n\n$55.12 per person on a Sunday!\nYeah.. it's a big buffet, but so not worth it unless you are a BIG meat and/or seafood eater!! Then MAYBE.. if you are really really hungry.\n\nI don't eat much seafood so I didn't even go to that area.\nThe crappy fried food was good and served in individual baskets.\nThe fresh made street tacos were average. \n\nThe dessert station was horrible!!\nDidn't like any of the desserts.\nThey sure look good but that's about it.\nWorst dessert buffet ever!!\n\nService was horrible................. S L O W on everything!!\nI would pass on this buffet!!", "I'm not one of those negative people whose life sucks, so all I write are negative yelp reviews.\n\nThis place is definitely a novelty concept compared to the other Vegas buffets, however, this is not a buffet that will not stand the test of time.  \n\nTHE FOOD IS SALTY!!   Most foods taste amazing when you add excessive butter or salt.   \n\nYou have to try this place at least once so you don't feel left out.  However, it's definitely not worth the wait or the money.", "The selection is not as many as I have expected. The plastic lobsters are for display only. The pasta is very salty and the Chinese BBQ dishes look scary. The desserts are top notched so there are extra points for that.", "After eating the Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet two trips in a row I was looking for something else, something MORE, something new... low and behold it was just a couple hotels down the street waiting for my arrival.\n\nUnfortunately it isn't the cheapest of places and I was prepared for that, because sometimes great food doesn't have a price. It was EDC weekend and it was Saturday brunch/lunch time so my wait time was around 45 minutes - one hour (like I said, I will do almost anything for food). Once we paid at the cashier it was another 15-20 minutes and that was a definite struggle as the smells from the continental buffet filled our nostrils and my tummy grumbled in anger. \n\nFINALLY, we were seated and I immediately mapped out my game plan: I hit the mexican station first, then ventured to the asian section, the fried foods/american section, the seafood section, and lastly the desserts. Although in theory this worked well, it was a mission trying to decide what I wanted at these various sections because everything looked appetizing. I didn't get a chance to try a bite of everything because there isn't enough space in my stomach for 8 countries of food. \n\nHere are some unique dishes that aren't at your atypical buffet: meatballs with bowtie pasta, fresh made to order crepes, baked chocolate chip cookies, brown butter caramel ice cream, al pastor tacos, oysters, mussels, xiao long bao (YES, I am from Arcadia this was a big deal). \n\nThis is a vegas MUST TRY I don't care what your favorite buffet is currently, JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, because you go BACCH, you always go back.", "I recently ate here Friday, June 21, 2013. My one big meal to fuel my weekend of EDC fun. But low and behold... I end up getting FOOD POISONING from something in their seafood dept.!!! It ruined my whole weekend! Stomach ache and violent diarrhea for the next 5 days!! It's the 6th day now and I'm FINALLY feeling better. They get one star b/c the only thing really good there was there dessert bar! Other than that, their food is nothing better than any of the other Vegas strip buffets and I will never ever be going back to Bacchanal Buffet again! Be warned... stay away from the seafood!", "OMG!! Vegas Buffets are crazy!!!  If you really need to go to a buffet then this isn's a bad choice!  they have a lot of food options but their price is very expensive and for the $40-$50 per person you can enjoy a good meal in vegas and not feel like you are dying or having stomach pain! \nThe wait is also extreme, we waited around 1 hour!", "Came here due to word of mouth, billboards claiming they are #1 in Vegas, and also because it was one of the selections in our buffet of buffets deal. So we chose the wrong weekend to come to vegas since every single buffet we visited was SUPER JAM PACKED (it was the week of the jewelry convention). The line for this one was so long it wasn't even funny. We made it in 30 mins before they were closing and I beelined for the raw oysters and seafood section. I must admit, the presentation for every single food item was beautiful and you could tell they spent a lot of effort, but I really was not blown away. Maybe I came when it was busy in Vegas or maybe it was near closing time but I mainly picked at a couple food items I liked. \n\nI ate massive quantities of my favorite shrimp cocktails and raw oysters. Some other notable foods were the black chicken soup in the chinese section (tasted VERRRY authentic so I give them props), their cheese and salami section, and also their gelatos, and chocolate strawberries. I would suggest offering maybe milk chocolate on the strawberries as well since some people HATE dark chocolate...hint hint..also the japanese section had no sashimi...!?!!? what!?!?...just some simple cut rolls that looked not so appealing..\n\nSome of the food items I didn't even get to try since it was closing time and they were wrapping things up which was another thing that annoyed me. If you are a buffet and you let people in near closing time then at least let them get all their food before you start shutting your bars down! \n\nOverall, I think this place is a one time deal...since I'd much rather pay much less and get literally the same foods (minus the oysters) at other top notch vegas buffets.", "I came to Bacchanal on a whim for lunch with a few co-workers and I was surprised to see so few vegetable dishes. There were plenty of meat dishes and noodles but not a lot of roasted vegetables for those who aren't into meat and carbs. As for desserts, I thought the items offered were very typical with nothing that stood out or made me go \"wow, I must consume that!\" \n\n\nI left disappointed and wanting for more.", "Food is just OK,Bellagio or wicked spoon is Way better. Customer service SUCKS big time especially that manager/leader on duty saturday night named JAMIE and that guy RYAN who was very rude and unprofessional.They need to take customer service classes from disney and nordstrom or better yet FIND another JOB.After waiting in line for 2 1/2 hours you guys need to know how to service your customers better.And i am not even complaining on the time we waited coz like anyone else we waited patiently, its just unbelievable how that girl Jamie can give me a remark to just leave my kids outside, how DARE you say that, same goes with that other guy. You both need to get FIRED.\nVery unsatisfied customer here:(", "First of all, I'm nothing if not cheap, so I sympathize with those reviewers who balk at spending $50+ to go to a freakin' buffet\n\n. After all, this is Las Vegas, birthplace of the incredibly cheap chow line, subsidized by gaming revenues and scoffing at the prospect of making money from the lowly food and beverage department. I get it. So, I highly recommend the practice of not eating during the day (easy if you sleep late), and arriving in line ON A WEEKDAY just before 3 p.m. That way, your wait in line will be practically non-existent, you will pay the lunch price (closer to $30), and they start trotting out the higher-end dinner items (I'm talking heated crab legs and lollipop rib eyes) almost immediately.\n\n  Now, imagine that you and a companion went for dinner in a regular restaurant, were served a basket of artisan breads with an assortment of cheeses and homemade jams, then you had a fried calamari appetizer, lobster corn chowder, Caesar salad, prime rib and crab leg combo  with broccoli au gratin and whipped potatoes, and creme' caramel for dessert. \n\nYour date had the oyster shooter, cream of mushroom soup, heirloom tomato caprese salad, saut\u00e9ed halibut with haricots vert and scalloped truffled potatoes, and a nutella crepe with bananas and whipped cream. Assuming you didn't have to be wheeled out, would you squawk if you were presented a bill for a little over $60? I think not. Of course, you have to factor in the major inconvenience of walking 10 feet to get it yourself, but that horrific downside is somewhat modified by the fact that while you're up there anyway, you can help yourself to more Asian, Italian, Mexican, seafood, dessert, etc., options than even the fattest of fatties could ever hope to sample in a week, let alone a couple of hours (in other words, until you're full to the point of physical distress).\n\n And here's the thing: you may not like every single thing you choose, some things may not be prepared exactly to your liking. Don't eat it!!! It's a buffet! Trot yourself up and pick out 15 more things until you stumble across stuff that meets your standards. Make yourself happy! This place is great and deserves 5 stars just for the fact that they have some poor OCD guy back in the kitchen cutting up watermelon and feta cheese and assembling them into those little checkerboard squares.\n\n.And we have had nothing but good experiences with the servers, especially the meat cutter,  who act like they're actually glad you're there. I hate to say it, but it's possible that if you don't like this place, maybe you don't really like food?", "Review is more like 3.5 stars.\n\nLong lines that moves fairly quickly, but once you get to the register you have to wait in another line to be seated. They have separate lines for large parties w/ 4\nor more ppl which they don't let you know until somebody checking the receipts says you're in the wrong line...Ughh...\n\nOnce seated the venue is really nice and spacious. The seats are quite roomy and really comfy. I hitted up the Asian section first since that had the shortest line. Peking duck, poke/sashimi, were my favorites.\n\nThe meat/ seafood line were ridiculous! I don't understand why they wrap around each other. If I wanted seafood I had to wait in the long meat line in order to grab seafood :/\nThat area really needs work with having a better setup for lines. \n\nI was really looking forward to trying the green-tea souffl\u00e9 that I was stalking through yelp days prior, but it was nowhere to be found! Hmph..!!!  I had the watermelon mint sorbet and that was really refreshing which was probably at the top of my list. They also had mixed berries w/ some type of simple sauce, but it was so memorable even till today. \n\nFor me I rate a buffet, by their dessert section. I have the sweetest tooth, and literally need a bib when desserts come by. But nothing really appealed to me and their macarons were so sad! One bite of the macarons and I regretted I even tried them. For a place so ridiculously expensive I had higher expectations. Unfortunately I was not blown away ;(.", "The quality of the food was 5 stars worthy. However, the \"service\" that was given to us dropped this restaurant to only 1 star. I've never written a review on Yelp, but I was so disgusted by the so called service. The restaurant limits diners to only 2 hours  of eating. However, I was unaware that the 2 hours began once you actually pay. The waiters and the restaurant do not take into account the time you have to wait to be seated as well. That alone takes up at least 30 minutes. My family and I paid at 2:50. Waited in line to be seated till 3:30. At 5:27 we were approached by a new waiter, our generous previous waiter's shift ended. The new waiter approached our table and looked at our receipt. He then left and came back with the manager. He then came back to our table and asked us to leave due to a 2 hour limit. For a second, it seemed as if he was the owner of the restaurant and not a waiter. He proclaimed and accused us of being there for nearly 4 hours, I was in shock and speechless and before I could reply he decided to leave. The manager just said 'sorry, there's a two hour limit.' He then approached the table across from us and also accused them of being there for 4 hours, when they say down after us. I've seen better service at a soup kitchen. We paid $170 + tax for this horrible service? It was my family's first time here and that waiter ruined the entire night for us. We will not return here, ever. Not even the food could save us and other customers from the waiter. I'm sure even if Jesus was sitting at our table we would have been approached rudely. It was our \"Last Supper\" there forever.", "Meh food.  service.", "Bacchanal versus Wicked Spoon... \n\nBacchanal has a modern and refreshing ambiance that invites you to feed your appetite.  The selection is superb; they have both cold and hot crab legs, raw oysters, various cuts of meat, the expected.\n\nThe temperature, texture, flavor, and overall quality of the food were just right and met my expectations.\n\nThe desserts, which I tend to value more than the actual entrees, were pretty good.  The cookie chocolate dipped strawberries could have been sweeter but were tasty and so were the miniature gummy bears.  They have macaroons too but I'm not a fan.\n\nBased on the above, I thought Bacchanal was excellent, but I pick Wicked Spoon why?\n\n1) Better dessert selection/quality\n2) Less wait time in the meat line\n3) Bacchanal failed miserably on their nigiri - one small plate that they hardly replenish.  The plate remained empty after two trips and when it was finally refilled the guy ahead of me took 2/3 of the plate, leaving me feeling bad for the people after me. Their staring got to me so I left a couple pieces (damn conscience!)\n\nI don't want to feel bad when I'm at a buffet, especially one such as Bacchanal. The last thing I should have here is a satisfied tummy, not a guilty conscience for carrying off the last piece of fish.", "A big fat disappointment.\n\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\n\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!", "Really hyped up buffet - line to pay for entry, line to wait for seating, line to fill your plate... Still in the end, I would do it again.  So much food,  I was too full to have any dessert.  The kicker - Bottemless Mimosas!", "So Chris and I arrived about 8pm-ish on a Saturday saw the line was crazy long, really we had no idea where it ended. So we left to go get a drink before standing in line, by the time we got back (20 mins later) it was under control and didn't seem to long. We chatted with some folks ahead of us from San Francisco so it made the hourish wait go by fast. When we finally got up to the front to pay one of the employees came and announced they were at full capacity and would stop letting people in at 10 and would pull food at 10:30. \nWe were next in line and figured mehh we waited all this time and we can eat in an hour. Never again will I do that! We felt rushed the whole time, I barely got to eat with my husband because either I was eating and he was up in line or the other way around.\nNow to the food. It's was OK, it wasn't worth the $102 we paid. When we came here in November they had KING crab and this time had crap snow crab. I was very disappointed! What I did like was the prime rib, oh boy was is cooked perfectly it was succulent and moist, and the lamb. I tried the Thai tea gelato and loved it, it tasted like the real thing. However, that's about it unfortunately. We loved it so much the first time and we were so sadly disappointed this time I doubt we'll ever be back.", "Food is great but service sucks \n\nWe waited half hour before refills on drinks never saw our waitress.\n\nShe got drinks wrong also.  \n\nThink her name was mercedes", "Worst buffet on the strip.\nSeafood was sitting forever even discolored.  The server was rude.  I've been every buffet on the strip and this place provides worst food and service ever.  I've been going to Caesars Palace since 1980 when I was in first grade and the restaurants in there are getting worse and worse although the appearance is getting better.\nDon't even try to go there to waist your precious money. You better go to Wicked Spoon, Wynn, M resort or even Rio Seafood buffet.", "Overrated buffet!!!!!!  Totally not happy about it!\n\nFirst of all, the wait was long when there were still so many opening seats available.  Forget about this because it was labor day weekend.  \n\nLet's talk about food.  A lot of varieties of food choice, but it tastes like inexpensive buffet that only cost less than $15.  Totally can't talk about quality here.  I wouldn't come back for this expensive but no quality buffet, unless you have no where else to spend your money.  Got that!?\n\nI would rather spend $60 for some decent quality of appetizer!", "My experience at this buffet can be described in three letters.... WTF?... It's low quality food at fine dining prices. My buyer's regret over this place is worse than loosing all that money in one of the casinos would be. The only way they can count 500+ dishes is if they count all the condiments in as separate dishes. It's your friendly neighborhood Todai Buffett at overinflated price and a long line to get in. Skip it to avoid huge disappointment and spend your money someplace else.", "Besides the seafood selection, the others are aiiiiiiiiite. The oyster shooters were realllllyy good though! Macaroons weren't that great.", "My friend and I were in Vegas for the Memorial Weekend.  We purchased Buffet of Buffets pass and in addition they charged an extra $25 for the Cesar's buffet.  Total we paid $105 per person.  I was told they charge $65/person for dinner because of holiday but regularly it's $50/person.  \nTheir cocktail shrimp and their crab legs were the best of all Vegas buffets that I've been to.  However, we only had one hour to eat and food was take away in 45 minutes because we only got seated at 10pm and they close at 11pm.  That was a horrible experience!  I think they should stop taking in people after 9pm.  You still have to wait in line for food after you get so it's totally a rip off if you get seated with less than 2 hours to eat.  \nBesides the large cocktail shrimp and the good size crab legs, nothing exceptional about this place.  sushi section was very small and pathetic.  Total not worth the money you pay for.  My advice to to skip it.", "I went for dinner, no stone crab, no lamb, no king crab, NO a lot of things. Service sucks all the way around and the bathrooms were dirty!!! It was so bad, and do not be a fool! Do not pay the xt $$ to get ahead of the line, the overall buffet is so not worth $70 plus tip. Go spend your money somewhere else!!! So not worth it, if u have a good taste for food, this is not the buffet for you, there are better!!!", "AWFUL!  AVOID!  I've had it with the overpriced buffets in Vegas.  Saturday and Sunday brunch price is not advertised on the website and you can't just buy breakfast on Saturday or Sunday.  So, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try because of all the great review, but no brunch buffet is $41.99 per person.  I'm not opposed to paying up for good food, but seriously, all I wanted was eggs, bacon and some toast.  Don't be a tourist.  \n\nThis place is designed by the same people who brought you the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan as evidenced by the posts that hold the ropes for the line.  Unfortunately, they don't have nearly the amount of space as the Wicked Spoon, so there's a ton of seating, but the buffet is crowded by the tables and people coming in.  In essence, you're cramped down to a single line along the buffet and with barely 25% of the seats in the place filled, there were long lines for the carved meat, seafood and omellete stations and there are only one of each.  \n\nMy girlfriend paid for brunch since I paid for dinner the night before, but from the moment my jaw dropped upon seeing the price - $90 and change for two people - things just kept getting worse.  We were first seated at a table which didn't have enough room to get into the second seat because it was crowded by a floor lamp.  They did move us, but I was extremely frustrated by this point.\n\nMimosas are included with the exorbitant price, so I ordered two and my girlfriend went to get food.  She had barely sat down when a child, obviously neglected by his parents, lobbed this little rubber handle they give you to pick up the metal dishes at the buffet at her, hitting her in the hair and then bouncing off her and landing right in the middle of the plate.  It was covered in BBQ sauce, so now she's go sauce in her hair and this thing right in the middle of the plate of food she'd just waited in three different lines to get.  Next, the 'owner' of the kid (I say that because he obviously had no parenting skills) starts mouthing off to us and which point I just started motioning for the wait staff or anybody else who attention I could get.  As much as I wanted to rip him limb from limb (he did quiet down a bit when I stood up and he realized I was 6'5\"/300), it's better to let the hotel handle it and I figured this way my chance to get out of this awful experience and get our money back.  As the manager approached, he started mouthing off again, swearing, etc. and I just told the manager I wanted this awful experience to end.  She took us to the front which calling security on the guy with the kid and refunded our money.\n\nOverall, and awful experience.  They did solve the problem and we did get our money back, but the bottom line is it's just another buffet and at $41.99/person, you can go to a decent restaurant for breakfast twice, get better food and not have to deal with the idiot tourists.\n\nUpon leaving, we went to Crystal's at City Center and ended up having lunch at Wolfgang Puck's.  Yea, I know it's a chain and I've eaten at the one at O'Hare too many times, but the service was fantastic, the food was good as usual and the atmosphere was soooooo much better.", "Was not a big fan of the Bacchanal Buffet.  For my  GF and I, we ended up spending 71.32 for lunch.  A majority of the food here was average and so was service.  Our server was polite but was barely around to refill our beverages.\n\nThey had a wide verity of deserts. But, besides the crepes and  macaroons nothing else really stood out.\n\nTip: Go for a late lunch! (2:15-2:30)  That  way you can experience dinner at lunch prices.", "Why, oh why, oh why did I have to be hungover as death when eating here?  I was literally squirming in my seat trying to keep my food going the right way (as in down, not back up).  I started with 2 soups, hot and sour and French onion, and crap-load of Sierra Mist.  The hot and sour was meh, the French onion was yummy, and the Sierra Mist was to die for.  I just wish I had felt better, because I know my perception was skewed due to the number of alcoholic beverages I had consumed the previous night.  Some things I probably would have loved were the antipasto meats and cheeses, and the tacos, but alas, I was forced to stick to soup and salad for the most part.  Boooooo.  Next time....I will wreck you.", "If you decide to go to a buffet in Vegas -- or anywhere else for that matter -- accept that you will inevitably (a) feel like you're getting ripped off if you don't constantly have a new full plate of food in front of you every 10 minutes, (b) feel the buttons of your jeans flying off as you're stuffing your face to get your monies worth, and (c) feel like a fatass afterwards, and possibly for the rest of the week after your grub-a-thon while wondering to yourself, \"Could I have eaten more?\" \n\nOnce you get past those three things and accept that buffet experiences are highly subjective upon one's own perception of value, you can't really go wrong with any high-end buffets. Unless of course, they are terribly bad at EVERYTHING.\n \nI've been here on two occasions. The first time was for dinner, in which I was blown away, not only by the buffet selection and display, but because I nearly did topple over from being so stuffed. The second time was for Sunday brunch and I have to admit, I wasn't all that impressed. In fact, I felt a bit ripped off having paid almost as much for brunch as I did for dinner but with a line-up that wasn't nearly as impressive. \n\nI had sworn off buffets after the disaster that was Scarpetta's brunch buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/scarpetta-beverly-hills#hrid:7vyQ6mSiz9IP0uS3Fu9dgg), and ended up losing my born-again buffet V-card to Bacchanal after more than six months. Thinking back, I think that had a lot to do with why I was so impressed on my first visit here, but sorely disappointed the second time around.\n\nMy first visit for dinner, there were oysters aplenty (on the half shell and shooters), crab legs, three different kinds of ceviche in cute little shot glasses, and a large selection of sashimi/sushi options. Since I'm not a huge meat eater, I couldn't comment too much on the meat selection, but between bites of sashimi and the boy feeding me forkfuls of random meat carvings, I think there were meats aplenty, as well. Aside from the seafood and red meats, the other buffet stations didn't disappoint either as there were a dish or two at each station that I kept going back for. Last but not least, the dessert display during dinner is totally Instagram-worthy. AYCE mochi ice cream, macarons, two flavors of creme brulee, mini cakes and mousse galore -- it was a diabetic's worst nightmare. \n\nIt was simply too bad that brunch was lacking in nearly all aspects of what was offered for dinner in terms of selection and quality -- no oysters, no ceviche, no sashimi, dry meats, no mochi ice cream, no macarons -- but having to pay almost as much only because of free flowing champagne. I know some of you raging alcoholics are trying to resist the urge to want to reach into your monitors and slap me silly for scoffing at the idea of AYCD champagne, but I seriously don't see the value in drowning my liver with $10/bottle sparkling wine because we all know \"champagne showers\" aren't really champagne showers unless it's with Cristal, Dom, or Moet -- I fancy. \n\nAll kidding aside, Bacchanal is great, but more so for the food porn and the experience of a fancy Vegas buffet than for the food itself. The quality is above average, but that's because you're paying above average prices and shouldn't expect anything less. After about 4 or 5 plates of food, though, it all starts to taste the same anyways and you're probably only eating to satisfy your wallet at that point. If you only have time for one buffet and decide on Bacchanal, go for dinner and have your phone ready for Instagram photo ops. \n\nDon't forget the stretchy pants.", "Overpriced, long lines. Noisy. Only one variety of fish--salmon--and even for that had to wait. Rude sitters and the cashier.  Paris and Wynn were much better.", "This place is over rated and overpriced ! Wait time is about 2 hours and you pay 51$ plus tax and if you can't wait too long you can add 15 more dollars and your wait time is about 15 min and i think that's shady business from management calling it express lane !!!\nFood is tasty but nothing special , I like their choices of meat and the way it's cooked but anything else is average and you can find it in any other hotel buffet (Wynn , Rio seafood and Bellagio ) . Our waiter was nice and helpful .  \nWe also heard a lot about their dessert choices but i wasn't really impressed  just normal buffet dessert .", "I'm not sure what all the hype is about here.  I was very disappointed. If all you want is crab legs and oysters this is your spot. Other than that, there's much to be desired. I highly doubt that there are 500 food items here. I pretty much stuck too the Chinese duck and chicken wings. For a strip buffet I will stick to wicked spoon at cosmopolitan.", "I really don't understand the hype.  Maybe I came here on a bad day?  \n\nThe dinner buffet was rather blah, I had the crab legs (hot and cold) and thought it was decent.  I tried some of the other items ... sliders, hot dog, risotto ... can't even remember them since it was so blah.  Mac n cheese was good but since when can you ever screw that up?\n\nI will give them an extra star for the desserts, love the ice cream.\n\nOverall, not a fan of the whole set up and how it's broken up into \"sections\".  Keep it simple Caesars!", "Got a comp because everyone in our party got food poisoning, came back to redeem it and the dark lady at the counter wouldn't redeem it nor call the manager. Wouldn't let my dog eat here. Don't take chances, you'll get sick and they'll treatyou like crap.", "For the money ($40+/ person), no oyster and terrible tasting mimosa? Not worth it.\n\nLast time, $20+ with oyster and without mimosa? Totally worth it.\n\nPretty decent prime rib but if you like the thicker cut, you have to ask for it. Otherwise, you may end up with an English cut sliver!", "i went to bacchanal for the 2nd time this past weekend for the thanksgiving holiday dinner buffet. it was a much different experience than my previous one. the first experience was worth 4 stars (note i had the brunch buffet then). the food was good, service was good, items were fresh, good selection. but nothing i had was exceptional. the only thing i would note is that they had a good selection fo juices in cute little bottles (something other buffets in vegas do not do).\n\nhowever, this past weekend was really disappointing. the experience shed a lot of light on the fact that money buys everything! i don't like the idea that they have an express line where you pay 20$ on top of your meal cost. makes the wait even more horrific. when i got to the buffet around 3:30pm i was quoted a 1.5 hr wait. okay, i was expecting that. but really the wait turned into 2.5 hrs because around 4:30pm they started getting more people in the express line and letting all of those people in first. i didn't enjoy having to double my wait time just because they want to make a quick buck. i was already paying 65$ (not including tip) for the buffet as it is. no other buffet in vegas does this (not that im aware of). HORRIFC! i can't imagine what the wait would have been had i came any later than 3:30pm! \n\nlets talk about the food: nothing was exceptional! everything was decent, nothing special because you can get the same quality and presentation at wicked spoon. actually, i think wicked spoon has better presentation.\n\nmeat: the selection of meat was good, but it was at the expense of quality. the ribs were dry with some weird flavored bbq sauce. prime rib was decent. the lamb chop was probably my favorite of the meats they offered. \n\nseafood: i was not impressed by their oysters. each one i bit into still had dirt/oyster shells cracklings on their meat. i bit into so many bits of oyster shells. king crab legs were good, but again, nothing exceptional since you can get those at any of the other high end buffets in vegas.\n\ndeserts: only cool thing about their dessert is that they had a good selection of mochi ice cream. but seriously, WTF is up with their carrot cake though? superrr dry!\n\nno thanks bacchanal, i won't be coming back.", "I think this is not a new buffet in town!! I just went there on Thanksgiving day, which is not the first Thanksgiving day. OMG I have to wait for 5 hours to be seated. Unprofessional management, there are a lot of table empty but no one clean it, so there are only 70% can provide to customers. 30% left unattended. \n\nThey charge for $10.- extra for Thanksgiving but no sign posted. \n\nThere have only 2 staffs working for almost 500 customers. Those 2 staffs served only their \"DIAMOND\" guest. The rest, just keep waiting, they don't care!!! \n\nWhen I complain to one of their staff, she complain to manager, who standing and do nothing, I just got bluffs back that he will kick me out from the hotel!!! WTF \n\nHe treated his staff better than his customers.\n\nThe food is great!! but I lost my appertise already.", "I've been to who knows how many buffets in Vegas and this is by far the best. It is the most expensive but you get what you pay for here. I can't even name everything I ate the last time but I am going back! Crab, prime rib, beef rib, dim sum, sushi, tacos, seafood... You name it they got it. The only thing that wasn't great was the sushi. Pretty poor showing for this but if you're going to do sushi do it right and go to a Japanese restaurant. Moral of the story... GO here if you have time if you want a great buffet.", "We did not have to wait and got right in which was good.Service was good and friendly even got me the drink I asked for that was not on their list.\n\nFOOD\nAwful not like it used to be at all\nCrab legs still tasted frozen and no meat inside\nSushi don't even try\nMussels awful and dry\n\nDuck and charcuterie was ok but not worth $40 each.\n\nHubby hated his lamb chops and could not eat them as smelled like burned rubber\n\nWon't come back too much hype for nothing at a high price!!!", "Not bad but defiantly not worth of waiting 3freaking hours in line! Spend $230 for 4 people, NOT worth it!", "Absolutely ridiculous, I understand that Christmas eve is busy and you may not have table available or need us to wait 3 hours to come back with a ticket. But changing the time on the ticket and telling us to go to the back of the line 2, 3 times is highly unprofessional and frankly not acceptable.", "After the 3 hour wait which was for the payment line of $60 pp, then another wait of 20 min for a table we had less than a full hour before closing. Keep in mind we arrived around 5:30 on a Tues. The wait and $ was so not worth it, a huge disappointment.  The line for seafood was long, the meat looked like it had been sitting around,  lots of labels missing so you just don't know what stuff is, very sad.", "Caesars Palace must have paid the newspapers to vote them as the best buffet in LV.  I went to Atlantis in Reno last year.   It's way better and cheaper.  They said they have king crab legs, but ends up with snow crab legs only.  The food is just average, and they charged us 50.99 per person on Christmas eve, that's ridiculous.  I gave them 2 stars because we could get a ticket which told us how long and what time to come back - 5 hours, so we don't have to wait in line for 5 hours.  But when we went back at the time showed on the ticket, we still needed to wait for 1/2 hours, that's fine.   But after we got in, we saw many empty tables with lots of empty plates.  No one cleaned those tables and they just made people wait outside.  If I'm the owner, I would be very mad.  The service is average.   No one refilled our drink until we asked the waitress.   I will definitely never go back again..", "We went to Bacchanal on Thursday at 2pm hoping for a short line during the 'transition' hours. When we got there, they were not allowing people to queue up for lunch. There was a new system with kiosks set up where you are given tickets for the next available time to come back ( similar to a Disney Fastpass). We were given a 7:15 pm  time which was in conflict with show tickets we had.  TIP: if you want to have your time moved, do what we did and speak with the  person at the small podium manning the start of the line and was able to get the time moved.  Don't listen to the other staff out front answering questions as told us to just keep coming back to try the kiosk. That would have been a big waste of time! \n\nOn to the food -- I had high expectations based on the past yelp reviews and pictures and I was a bit disappointed. \nThe Good - crab legs, side dishes like the tater tots, truffle potato, lamb chops, gelato\nThe Bad -  tasteless chewy sashimi, no macarons (boooooo), \nMost of the other stuff were so so.\n\nPresentation seemed to have been value engineered. More than half of the food selections are no longer served on the cute tiny individual plates like the older review pictures show. \n\nOverall, the food was just ok, but not worth the $$$ or the extra planning effort.", "We went to dinner and we were expecting lots of seafood and a variety of sushi. Very disappointed and over priced. The salmon was over salted. We tried it and are never going back.", "Tried this place for the first time this past weekend. Came here for Sunday Brunch with my family. There were about 13 of us (8 adults, 3 kids, and 2 toddlers) \n\nThere is a 18% Gratuity Charge for parties over 8. That's like an additional $75 bucks for us getting our own food, just to be seated together. Seriously?! We decided we didn't want to pay that ridiculous amount for minimal service. Which I'm glad we didn't. The waitress rarely came by to our area. So they spilt us all apart. One group of 4 adults, 1 kid, and 2 toddlers. Then 2 adults and 2 kids. Then finally 2 adults. They wouldn't sit the 4 adults and 2 kids together. Seriously?! That's just bullshit. When the lady in the front obviously told us we can do 4 adults on each table. Then her dumbass changed her mind. Ugh so annoyed.\n\nFood was only ok, but not worth $48. Some stuff are overly salted. Others are just plain. Only 2 things I actually liked there was giant shrimps and the crepes. \n\nFor the price you pay, you would think they would be a lot larger. Nope. I think they're actually smaller than most of the other buffets. \n\nWould I come back here? Nope. Not even if you paid me to. Bad first impression.", "So here's what happened:\nMy family and I came on Christmas Day and had to wait 4 hours. FOUR FREAKING HOURS?!?!?!??! Are you kidding me?!?!??! But you know what? It'll be okay right? After this is SUPPOSED to be the best buffet in vegas. So we waited, got seated, and went to go ransack this joint. \nFood was okay, nothing stood out, except maybe the pho.\n\nNow onto the desserts. THIS is where it gets disappointing. \nSo one of the much anticipated options with this buffet is the fact that you can get made to order souffl\u00e9s, right? The employees DENIED that. WHAT?!!??? I don't even want to talk about this anymore...And then, they ran out of chocolate strawberries, and said they wouldn't make any more. WHY?!?!! I also tried the thai tea gelato and mochi ice cream. Thai tea gelato was flavorless and I've had better mochi ice cream from my local grocery store.\n\nOverall this place is NOT worth coming to. GO TO WICKED SPOON", "$178 for two ppl.  At this price- so not worth it.  Per person breakdown: $60 holiday price + $20 express lane + TIP because the cashier stares as you're signing and eyeing to see if you are tipping and the she STAMPS your receipt with big block letters that say TIP on top.  It's weird, I'm gonna say it. \n\nThe buffet itself is ok.  It's hella messy.  Food ain't made with love.  If I wanted bad dim sum I can get it a buck each at Dim Sum express.  \n\nOh but the dessert.  We are talking premium price, I expect french macarons made with almond flour with perfect macaron feet.  But there are no macarons.  There are gelato, different colors but same flavor.  The best thing are the jumbo chocolate covered strawberries.  \n\nSome of the memorable items: super dry hamburgers the cooks keep shoving forward but no ones touching, the made from concentrate juice bar, the crazy hectic layout, frazzled stressed out waitresses blaming each other for petty shit.\n\nWicked Spoon is a step above this.  Wynn buffet is a step above Wicked Spoon.", "The last time we were in vegas, we went on buffet-hopping and Bacchanal was on the list.\n\nWe tried Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon and the Buffet at Aria.\n\nWell, after trying all three I would prefer Wicked Spoon over the much-hyped Bacchanal. The only reason it was a 4 stars instead of 3 stars is because of the great service we got from our server. Food selection, quality, presentation and taste is 3 stars though.\n\nBachannal does have a lot of different kinds of foods. On the day we were there, however, we saw danishes on multiple different places. We didn't find any macaroons that some other yelper posted on yelp.\n\nFor $51 per person, I came in with a higher expectation than what we had been given. I would prefer to go with Wicked Spoon for $35 and selection, taste, presentation.", "One of my worst experiences in Las Vegas. We came for brunch expecting a good morning. After being seating and grabbing food we started to eat and were dying of thirst because drinks took about 8 minutes. \nAll the food is super salty. The pork dumplings tasted very processed and store bought. \nPancakes were dried out and crunchy around the edges. \nThai curry chicken was very bland and couldn't taste much curry. \nThe worst part was going to grab food and when coming back the plates are still all over the table and you have no room to place dishes.", "After spending 80 bucks per person ($ 20 for express lane) to avoid the 3.5 hr wait, you would think their food or service would be top notch, but NOOOOOO..... They are nothing spectacular to adjust for the money spent..... The lines to get the popular food are long, 15-20 min wait for the meats, have to wait for them to shuck the oysters every time, have to wait for pho because they ran out, have wait for cooked crab legs because they ran out...... wait, wait, wait....... and the kicker is they try to enforce the 2 hour dinning time on us while tables all around us were either empty or not clean up yet. Of the 2+ hrs there, we probably waited another 50 min just to get food, maybe they should worry more about improving their service and food and try to make customers happy... what a rip off...", "We came here on Thurs. Jan 2 at 8pm and was told by the snobbish host that they are not letting anyone in without tickets. We told him that we are willing to wait and he said no.  We asked about paying extra for express line and was also told that it was not available. If you want to try this buffet, come and get a ticket like five hours in advance. We met a local couple and they told us they have been there twice. First time when it first opened and one more time recently. They said it is all for hype folks just like any new buffet in Vegas. I'm frustrated that they turned us and so many other people away.", "First of all the, it is going to be a long wait. I went first night at 6:30pm, which was a terribly wrong decision. Gave up after 1.5 hours of wait without getting close to the gate. Next day I went at 2:30pm, still had to wait almost 3 hours and seated around 5:30pm. So if you are going, be prepared, and that's why it has one star off. If you are willing to skip the oyster and Macaron, then the brunch is cheaper and line was almost non-existent.\n\nThe place look fancy AND the food is good. Food selection is wide: Seafood, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, etc. It is definitely not an average level buffet.", "Worst buffet experience ever!\n\nCame here on Christmas day with my family. We registered at 3 and got in at 6 pm. As you would think this is rated the best buffet in LV, it should worth the wait, right? Wrong! I've asked the lady at front desk and make sure they serve King Crab legs before we checked in. But later found out they do not serve King Crab at all. I asked the seafood section they told me to check with Italian section. I asked Italian section they sent me back to seafood section. If you don't have it, just tell me you guys are too cheap to serve King Crab, please don't lie to me.\n\nI tried to find white fish and found they only have salmon. I was looking for sushi and found non of them were eatable. I thought I should at least find tons of fruit at this price point. Wrong again, fruit were very limited. We've tried all the food there and only found disappointment. I think my neighborhood's $11 buffet is better than this.\n\nI concluded my experience on this trip. Any buffet place crowded with tourists (Wicked Spoon, Wynn...etc). Don't get in there. They will serve you second grade food. Shame on you, Vegas! I miss the old day soooooo much!!!\n\nIf you are looking for quality buffet in Vegas. Don't go for buffet places but go Sunday Brunch (Mozen, Sterling, Fountain...) and get your money worth.\n\nThe one star is for the decor.", "It was just okay. We paid $45 each for lunch . I thought that the beef sliders were the best thing they had there followed by the crepes. They had a lot of food to choose from but it was nothing great.", "I would have liked to review the food but that would be difficult.  We arrived at Ceasars which is difficult to navigate to begin with.  Arriving in the buffet area we are told to login and be given our time to eat.  We asked if their buffet was still included in the 24 hour deal and we were assured they were.  We waited 90 minutes to be called.  Then we were told it was an additional $30.00 per person to dine there with the 24 hour deal.  The deal was also $15.00 more than before.  So after waiting for 90 minutes we are told to eat there is going to cost 30.00 above what is paid for the buffet deal.  Totally ridiculous.  And by the way - to expedite your space you could pay $15.00 each.  And if you are handicapped - only one person may go in with you - the rest of your party can wait until they are called.", "Felt like I was in a dystopian sci if movie, filling me with fear and dread for the human race, which is precisely what I wanted out of a Las Vegas buffet.", "food was awesome.if you go at the right time no waiting in line. alot of selections!!! and their desserts....Mmmmmmm!!!", "Not sure how to rate a nice place and balance it with the fact that 4 out of 6 of our party got food poisoning. If they can eliminate the food poisoning part of the equation I would give it 4.5-5 starts.\n\nAnyways we had a party of 6 do a late lunch/early dinner on Sunday 2/1 at Bacchanal. It's by far the nicest buffet place in Vegas...except for the food borne illness potential. It wasn't the crab or seafood counters...so had to be either the meats, sushi, or desserts counters. The doctor in our group noticed symptoms for himself by 10pm Sunday and warned the rest of the group. By midnight I had symptoms. By next morning two others in our group were also sick with the same gastrointestinal issues.\n\nWould I go back if they eliminated the food borne pathogens? Yes. Could they though based upon volume and quantity? Probably not.", "If the fresh corn tacos are there. You need to get it. ASAP.

I thinks the soups went bad or something.\n-miso cod was hard and extremely salty with the miso.\n-try the TRUFFLE SCALLOPED POTATOES. I was crying tears of joy after the first bite.\n\nWent here on a Thursday and got in after 15minutes. Wouldn't dare coming here on a weekend. Some people wait up to 3 hours. I don't think it's worth that long however.", "If you're looking for a quality buffet this is not it! If you're looking for variety and quantity then this 1 might cut it. In my opinion this buffet is not worth $50? $30 max!", "Horrible!!! I'm now suffering from food poisoning ! \n\nTo start off I actually liked some of the food, though some of it was way too salty! And the variety isn't all what it's cracked up to be... Well now thanks to this place I'm very ill... I promise this is the source of my sickness bc this is the only food I've eaten all day....", "Sadly I have to update my prior review of this place. I visited on October 2013 and I was so happy with my overall experience that I mistakenly made it a point to visit again on Feb 16, 2014.\n\n\n          For starters this is currently the \"#1 buffet\" in Vegas and its advertised everywhere you go in Vegas thus making it extremely popular. I firmly believe that it started out as a wonderful buffet. However now it has gone down the drain with its horrible customer service.\n\n          For instance as you approach the buffet you are assaulted with big crowds of people trying to figure out what to do. Moreover as you get a glimpse of what everyone is crowding around its a monitor that allows you to input your party information. It then prints out a ticket informing you of the wait time encouraging you to go the surrounding shops and or casino instead of waiting in line and you will receive a text message letting you know when your time is up. (for me it was a 2 hour and 30 minute wait) The idea of it all is great. However in practice it is extremely unpractical to believe that crowds of people visiting your establishment will figure out exactly what to do with those little monitors. Consequently making it a big confusion for a lot of the patrons visiting the establishment. Then finally when you see a human face Patrons flock to the person asking him/her what are the steps to sign in. The \"hostess' rudely responds that you must use the monitor with no inclination to assist you in using it. Granted it is not rocket science here in the states similar monitors are now everywhere with \"self checkout\" being extremely popular. However I feel that she was incredibly inconsiderate to people asking for assistance. More importantly there are patrons that truly do not understand the concept of checking in  on a monitor. I can understand that she is probably assaulted with the same question over and over again and it might be incredibly overwhelming to repeatedly answer the same question.\n \n\n\n         However  rudeness is never acceptable. Secondly and more importantly after patiently waiting for an over two hours I directed to my table. Ironically the restaurant is beautifully designed however there where empty tables everywhere with dirty dishes stacked on them. It seems as if they paid so much attention to detail however the dirty dishes throw away all that effort.  It definitely killed my appetite. After 15 minutes of waiting we still had no waitress no utensils no drinks. I quickly became infuriated at the fact that I had wasted TWO HOURS of my life waiting to enter this dirty restaurant with incredibly inconsiderate staff. I asked the \"hostess\" if our waitress/waiter would show up anytime soon with which she replied \" she is making her rounds.\" I was FLABBERGASTED. I have no problem with waiting my turn however after paying $60 dollars a plate and waiting more than 2 hours to be seated I expect for them to have it more under control and at the very least have some kind of human empathy. I WILL ABSOLUTELY NEVER AGAIN VISIT THIS ESTABLISHEMENT AND DO NOT RECOMMEND ANY ONE TO SPEND A DOLLAR HERE. The food is ok but for the most part Rio offers the same food for a fraction of the wait time and better customer service. Mc Donald's workers have better training and service than the workers at this place.", "Extremely over hyped. I was so disappointed. This was all very cheap food. Its no better than $10 buffet. I really thought it would live up to all the hype but it didn't. Anyone who thought this was a 4+ star buffet hasn't been to a good one, like Wicked Spoon. Save yourself the grief and spend your money on a quality place.", "3 stars for variety and dessert but not for the taste. Been here 2 years ago when it was just 2 months after opening. It was very good, it WAS. Took my parents here expecting king crab leg but they didn't have it, on a Sunday night, I paid $53+tax. Without the king crab leg, it just a regular buffet. When I was here before, the chef helped the customer heat up the king crab leg in the boiling water, now they just do it for snow crab leg and let the crab leg sit in the pot until you ask for it. Almost every food taste very salty, hot and sour soup is bitter after simmering all day. Steamed bun is crusty because no lid covering. So, if you really want, you can ask or walk in to see if they have king crab leg before you pay for nothing.", "Totally overblown hype....been going to buffets in Vegas for over 40 years....their system to get in is a joke,...more than half the items weren't marked what they were... the atmosphere is cold with a lot of metal...food was o.k. but nothing like the reviews stated...the price was way too high also ..116.00 for two on Sunday...Still has a long way to go to match the Wynn Buffet....", "In terms of quantity, Bacchanal Buffet is No. 1 in Vegas. In terms of price, \nservice and maybe even quality, it's No.2. \n\nI'm gonna skip a lot of food details because there are tons of new reviews every \nday about this place. The Mexican section and the meats were my favorites but \nthey have almost everything you can think of. I'll just say this: You cannot \npossibly eat it all. And what you do eat is of quality taste and preparation. \nBut it's impossible to \"get your money's worth\" and any time spent waiting in a \nline for this is time wasted. I think the only way I'd go back is if it wasn't \nmy choice, which is to say if friends of mine wanted to go, I would join them. \n\nDo not mistake this for a bad review -- the place is expensive but tasty. It's \njust not my favorite. Wanna know what is?", "Went for the Friday night $55.00 dinner...here ya go folks...Bellagio and Rio are WAAAY better\n\nTotally bummed on this. Not what I expected, not what everyone else experienced either I guess :(\n\nI was super stoked on this place as its rated the \"Best\" I Yelped it and I was excited...super sad faced now...\n\nFood Coma? For sure, of course, satisfied though? Nope.\n\nThe Lobster Corn Chowda had no Lobster, the Miso Glazed Sea Bass was so fishy and cold it was inedible. The crab did not come off the legs even though they were split and the ribs tasted funny...like crappy funny :(\n\nI was really looking forward to the Souffle they make to order...didn't have it, FAIL. \n\nI was excited for the chicken basket everyone was bragging about on here, didn't  have it, FAIL :(\n\nI went to get Pho, no one was there to help me and I wanted the soup dangit!!\n\nBeers were cheap, service was good but I really cant say much more...Oh wait, yes I can...I got DIRTY SHRIMPS...nuff said :/", "Caesar's Palace? I would have done better to go to Little Caesar's.\n\nI have to that, in a lifetime of eating in buffet restaurants, from cruise ship buffets to hometown smorgasbords, this is the single worst experience I've ever had.\n\nWe pulled into Vegas exhausted and hungry after an 8-hour drive, and decided to just do the buffet at Caesar's Palace, where we were staying. We'd heard it was good, and, as we both have dietary restrictions, we thought it would be a pretty good bet. Usually we have no trouble finding enough that we can eat on a good buffet, and we were too tired to plow through restaurant listings to try to find something better that could accommodate us.\n\nBefore I go on to the food, I do have to mention the price. Yes, I get that everything in Vegas is expensive, but $116 for a buffet meal for two people that doesn't even include a beer is pretty OTT. I don't like most soft drinks, so that meant water for me (or pay more on top of the already outrageous price for something drinkable). We probably should have backed out at that point, but we were starving and we were on vacation, so...\n\nStill, it would have been OK if the food had been decent, but it was just horrible. In fact, It's difficult to describe just how terrible the food was. The salad greens were dried out and wilted. The salad dressings were completely mixed up, and dressings from one container dribbled into others. This was a serious problem, as my husband has a dangerous seafood allergy and one of the dressings was Caesar. None of the employees seemed to know which dressing was which, or what was in anything. We finally had to ask for  a separate bowl of ranch dressing to make sure he didn't get something that had been contaminated with seafood.\n\nOn the pizza bar, the only vegetarian choice was plain cheese, and it was bland and tasteless. I've had better pizza from the freezer compartment at Safeway. The rice and beans on the Mexican bar were also dried out and next to tasteless. Even the pita in the Mediterranean section was dry. I have, seriously, had better food in a high school cafeteria.\n\nTo make things worse, the steam table in the carvery section was badly in need of cleaning. I couldn't stand to walk past it, the smell was so bad. Really nasty!\n\nFinally, to add insult to injury, the dish of pistachio ice cream I got  in the hopes of finding SOMETHING worth eating for that kind of money tasted more like vanilla than pistachio. \n\nSuffice it to say we won't be back. If we want another buffet meal in Vegas we'll walk over to Mirage...it's pricey too (though not this pricey!), but at least the food is edible!", "I was excited to come try this place out since I heard good things but was quickly disappointed when most of the food was cold. There is a variety of food to try but quality is sub par. It's not worth the price and will not return.", "My second trip to the Bacchanal buffet was not the same as my first experience. This second time around was disappointing. Lamb chops where tough and not eatable. BBQ beef ribs where partially raw. Shrimp cocktail was off. I found it strange that there was no line on a Sunday night around diner time. I'm so bummed b/c we had such an amazing first experience. Probably won't be back considering how expensive this buffet is. :(", "It was worth a try, good selection but the Asian section needs some work. The dim\nSum was dry and not edible. The sushi was something you'd expect from a hole in the wall buffet in your home town. Pad Thai was greasy. The Mexican section was also disgusting. I only stuck with the meat carving area and seafood. Although I had bubble guts all day after eating here. Idk if it was because of the Nasty Asian food I tried or from the oysters. If I am going to pay buku bucks for a buffet, id expect everything to be up to par. At least everything to be edible.", "This is the only buffet on the strip to challenge the Wicked Spoon. The food here is tasteful, however they are beyond stingy with their mimosas (and when you're paying for unlimited, they better taste up to my standards). The overall experience at the buffet was good, however there were a few issues. The host at the cashier stand was not very friendly and the server was asked by the hostess to take two groups to two different tables, he mixed up the tickets numbers and gave the party of 2 that was before us the table we were supposed to have. When he realized his mistake, we had to go back to the front of the wait line and wait another 10min for a table.", "Went on Thanksgiving. Thought it was overrated for the price. We went for the Alaskan King Crab, there there wasn't any. Not sure I'll ever go back.", "Had lunch buffet last week. It was a good meal but still disappointed compared to what I paid. Also disappointed that the variety of food is far less than what I expected, maybe because it was lunch, not dinner.", "The problem with going to a buffet is that it's a buffet.  While the selection was vast, with foods from all types of cuisines, the quality of the food and cooking in general is mediocre.  The chinese food reminded me of a typical Chinese buffet, the sushi was sloppily made and rice was just bad, the miso marinated sea bass was way overcooked and had a weird texture because of it, the \"prime rib\" was tough and dry, the lamb chop was overcooked,  the crab legs were still partially frozen, and the oysters made me wonder if I was going to be spending time with the porcelain goddess later that night.    \n\nIn summary, this place is all show and very little substance.  If you want to go somewhere where you can just stuff your face with as many mediocre things as you can, then this is the place for you!  But if you would prefer just a nice meal cooked with skill and thought, accompanied by a nice alcoholic beverage, there are too many good restaurants in Las Vegas to ever even consider going to this buffet, especially for how much this place charges you.", "Didn't even get to try this buffet because their \"ticket system\" is ridiculous. \n\nFirst, they give you a ticket that says come back in 2 hours. So upon return we find out that we have to wait another hour to pay for the food. \n\nWe decide to wait and wait and wait. After the hour, we go up to the cashier and ask how long is the wait to get seated, \"average wait time is 45 min.\" \n\nWe look at the time and see by the time we actually get in the buffet will close in 45 min!!! At this point, we all leave and go to wicked spoon at the Cosmo where it was a 10 min wait and cheaper!\n\nFor Vegas standards, bachannol needs to get it together. Hungry patrons beware!!!", "I have been here 5 times before and loved it . The time before last I felt the quality and cooking was a little off but thought I came on a bad day. My wife and myself went again yesterday and had a repeat experience. Food was not hot at many stations the salads didn't have that artsy style they had before and the ceviche was sour with no real flavor, clams and chorizo  tasted liked over done clams with a can of corn chowder dumped on them . The BBQ server was very rude and when I went to get my meat and then again when I realized the BBQ sauce was not out and I had to ask for some he told me to get in line. My overall experience this time was very poor . I don't think I will be back because for the $160 I paid for 2 people ($30 bucks to skip line) I could go to Wicked Spoon and get better service too.", "Good food selection and quality of good is much better than most buffets around. The ribeye I had was very dry but I got the end of it. My buddy had a fresh one and it was juicy. Nice venue, good selection, and quality. Well worth with it. The reason for only three stars is because the service we had was very poor. Cashiers made an error on check regarding gratuity and we said we'd pay cash but the person seating us rudely disregarded us and wouldn't seat us until that was fixed. Their fault anyways. Very rude service on that end. I am big on customer service and this one failed horribly.", "Overall: swanky buffet but it's not as tasty as it looks\n\nPros\n-all kinds of food\n- gelato is super tasty\n- mushroom truffle soup\n-charcuterie station\n-crepe station\n\nCons\n- the seafood was rather sad/ bad\n- no crab legs\n- lines for anything like prime rib or tacos take forever \n\n\nSidenote: \n-come if you have no plans, lines are so long it's hard to say when you'd get out of here\n- quality is lacking, especially when you are paying this much for a buffet", "This place made me want to sleep in here. Came to get a reservation ticket. The wait said an hour, lady at the front hooked it up and let us in 5 mins after we got the tickets. The food is pretty good, but the desserts were so damn bomb. Probably gained 20pounds, but was so worth the $50 each. A must buffet destination to go in vegas.", "Very weak during lunch. Vegas has too many better options. I wanted to try it cause it's so hyped up right now.. not worth the 2 hour wait on a Sunday. Food was terrible, most of it. Oyster quality sucked. Prime rib was over cooked and salty. Sushi fish was okay, but the rice made it nasty. The steamed crab legs were good, and the yellow curry. Then I enjoyed the green tea and horchata. The dessert section was very weak. Overall this place is pretty small... and I was very disappointed.\n\nNot worth the hype and I probably won't be back.", "Bachelor party with my boys, came here for breakfast. It was my second creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, dug in, tastes bad. Egg inside tasted and looked rotten. I Tell manager, she says this week is pistachio flavor!?! She leaves to checks with chefs. Comes back, says \" oh no it's green tea\". Right...cause that's how it should taste. Horrible customer service. Tried to deny the buffet has issues. I'm insulted she thinks as an adult i can't tell the difference between rotten, pistachio, or green tea. Second time here and this happens. How do you make a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with top yellow and bottom this nasty green color? Aside from THIS, buffets really nothing special to me. I prefer Bellagio.", "Other than 500 suckers waiting in a 2 hour line ( I had front of the line passes) this place is top notch, not your typical Vegas buffet!!! Worth every penny$$$$$", "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \n\nThe price is $35.99 per person\n\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.", "I'm here again found out they don't serve ribeye anymore major disappointment and the lamb chops not quite good also.  The oysters seem to take awhile to be brought out.  Hot crab legs over by the Italian side and the cocktail shrimp are still good.  The sliders are still awesome.  The desserts are good also.", "Meh - it wasn't that impressive. I would have rather paid $700 for 5 star service than being in a cattle line.  The food was nothing to write home about.\nWe had to stand in line for over 2 hours, only to have our party split into 2 groups and placed separately. I might go back, but not during dinner on a weekend. No, they don't take reservations.", "The Bacchanal Buffet has gone down hill. We had a group of 30 people come in for brunch on a Sunday. Problem? Yes. There was no brunch food. How can you call yourself a brunch and not have any breakfast food? No eggs, waffles, bacon, or pancakes. Don't get me wrong, I like burgers, but not at 10 am with a mimosas.  \n\nMy suggestion is: if you are looking for a solid brunch buffett, if go elsewhere. Disappointing.", "We ate during dinner on May 19th. HORRIBLE food!!! I had some cocktail shrimp and oyster...I could not even eat it from the spoiling by the minute smell. I have had some great Oysters in Louisiana so I know how they should taste like. Then the dim sum...OH MY OH MY! The hacao was so mushy and the inside was powdery. The pad thai was dry. The only thing decent was the hummus, pita, and tabbouleh. The macaroons were decent as well as the cheese cake. My prime rib was alright but my husband got a slice that was very chewy. I would not pay more than $19 for this buffet. Go to Bellagio's Buffet instead. This place is not worth the money.", "Buyer beware!!  The \"automated seating system queue\" is not an automated system at all!  Plan to wait 1 1/2 hours past your wait time.  \n\nThey do not cut off the line at any point, so you will continue to wait in the \"to be seated\" line after you pay.  This is absolutely ridiculous!  In addition, if you pay the $20 extra per person fee to be seated \"immediately\", you still have to wait in the 1 1/2 hour \"to be seated\" line.  \n\nWhat a joke!  They capture you at the hotel so that you have no option but to stay and wait it out.  Won't be back.", "Are you kidding me??????? $62.99 for a buffet!!!!! Enough said....\nThe buffet was wonderful, but not worth $69.99 a person.  Raising rates for Memorial day is shameful!! There are a lot of active and retired military families in Las Vegas.  Seems a bit harsh Caesar's", "Is this place better than Wicked Spoon? Probably.  But would I come back, probably not.  We came on a Tuesday night at 8:30pm and yes it took an hour.. just to enter.  The only time you should wait that long for food, is if they are handing it out for free. People talk about great service, ours was craptastic to say the least.  \n\nI always believed you shouldn't pay gratuity up front, so that your waiter would be more inclined to work for their tip.  Having no cash for a tip after, I decided to leave an up front 20% tip ($20) to our server.  And sure enough we ended up with one, whose only responsibility mind you is to clear plates and make sure your drinks are full, who loved to disappear for 15 minutes at a time.  On one instance, my gf made eye contact with her and waved to her to come, she completely ignored her and walked away.  ??????  This may have been an anomale since it was my first time, but the 5 times I've been to Wicked Spoon, i've experienced above average service.  \n\nOther than that.  The only disappointment, was that there was no bone marrow which is the only reason I would go to Wicked Spoon over this place, well plus it usually takes less than 10 minutes to be seated.\n\nThe Oysters were good, crab legs were salty from preservatives. theres was this white saucy shooter with salmon that was awesome. Brisket was salty. dolmades good.  tabouli was meh, wicked spoon's waaay better.  asian section here WAY better than wicked.  salad bar not so  much. menudo had NO tripe, wth.  deserts were real good, I would say tied with wicked.\n\nAgain at $51 per person, a bad first experience with our server and an hour+ wait time, i'd just go to Wicked Spoon if I really want to eat a buffet.  The selection here is BETTER don't get me wrong, but seriously, that wait time just to eat... \n\nPS:  right before you enter, there are two lines that go left and right.  THERE WAS NO SIGN to direct large parties to the right and smaller parties to the left.  My gf and I went right, and about halfway in, some lady with a camera tells us we were in the long line, which extended our wait time by another 10 minutes.  At $51 per person, you would think they would have enough money to make a sign.", "i'm not sure how you can find out the prices without calling caesars palace. we paid $54.99 each for a non-holiday sunday dinner. lots of vegetarian options. crab legs were adequately defrosted. nigiri and roll sushi were passable--excellent by buffet standards. i think this has surpassed the wicked spoon in terms of the best vegas buffet, with bellagio and wynn close behind.\n\nhighlights:\nmushroom polenta\nbeet salad...ok, hard to go wrong with this one\nmochi ice cream...ditto\ndo it yourself congee, with all the toppings...dried pickled radish, 1000 year egg, fried garlic, wonton strips, green onions...the whole shebang! \n\nfor those who care, the carving station included:\nindividual lamb chops in a sweet marinade\nprime rib\nbrisket\nchicken sausage\nanother type of sausage\n\nbathroom was outside and fairly small--this was annoying.", "Starting to go downhill.\n\n2nd visit in May 2014, one of the hosts was really rude to us.  As was one of the cooks at the meat carving station.\n\n3rd visit in June 2014 someone needs to regulate the lines.  and the food wasn't as good.  the meat was terrible.  brisket seasoning was subpar.  and the prime rib was really dry.\n\nPho, Tacos, Sliders, Crab Legs, Beef Chow Fun were all good.", "I never eat at buffets  but when I do....  I'm highly disappointed and disgusted . So much variety,  yet not one delicious dish.  I love quality,  I guess I will have to be content with quantity.  But I won't,  I refuse to conform to the masses.\n\nThe wait time here for dinner after 3pm ranges from hour and a half to three hours.  You get a ticket stamped with a time to come back at.  Once you're in,  you are seated and then you can join the frenzy of other dinners trying to grab the \"best of the buffet\".  The best probably being the crab legs and oysters. Or the California rolls (they call it sushi) or a mosh posh of pasta , Mexican ground beef hard shell tacos,  Chinese chop suey or overly mayo clams.  U pick your poison. \n\nWhen everything is said and done or half eaten you're left with a full belly of despair and dissatisfaction. \n \nNext time family or friends come in from out of town,  they're on their own if the suggest we eat at a buffet.", "Downgraded to a solid 4. Wynn and Cosmo outdo here now. They ran out of King crab, so they served whatever was left from day before an blended in a very few pieces with the snow crab to fool the customer (doesnt work) and then they ran out completely. This was for Sunday brunch early morning.", "I went to the Bacchanal Buffet this past Friday night. It was NG. I really do not think it is worth what I paid. My husband and I have heard how great the buffet was. We were excited about going to try it because they claim they are the best buffet in Vegas. We paid $116.73 for two. Alcohol is an additional charge. We had two glasses of white wine for $18 including the tip. The total bill was about $135 for two people.\nI saw a dirty, disgusting spot on the chair when the host seated me. They switched the chair for me when I pointed out the problem to them. However, they simply swapped it with a chair from another table.\n\nThe food selection was low. There was an Asian section. Chinese dishes were typical cheap American Chinese food. Crab was soaked in a heavy soy sauce starch gravy.  There was a couple of dim sum. The fillings of those dishes were not fresh, skin was on the thick side. On top of that, they really did not taste that good. Japanese food included a few typical rolls and they were mediocre at best. My husband tried the pizza, he said it was all right. If you like cheese, you will not find any good ones here. The selection was poor, and they were old and cheap. I tried yellow cheddar, white cheddar and Brie, and that was pretty much all they had. \n\nItalian assuage was OK. Sea bass was terrible. They were cold and old. Crab legs has nothing special to mention. Dessert was just OK. I have had better ones somewhere else. I am disappointed about them. They said the buffet included soft drinks, but that does not include latte. I chose the coffee at the end of the meal. It was not that good at all. I believe it was cheap coffee. \n\nOverall, I believe they have cut corners. The ingredients are on the cheap side. Believe me, there is no such thing as dishes made to order on the spot. It turned out to be false talk that they have been putting in people's ear. I truly regret going there. I ended up eating some cheap (at a high price) food that I normally do not eat. My definition for this buffet is \"cheap\" ingredients + American cooking techniques + fancy name ( I am looking at you BACCHANAL) = TV dinner in Caesars Palace . I HATE IT. If you do not believe me, please go find out by yourself. \nif you need any advice where to eat in Vegas (and it probably won't cost as much as Bacchanal Buffet) you should try \"Joe's Stone Crab\" at Cesars, \"Social House\" for Japanese food in Crystal and \"Sushi Roku\" in Caesars (with a great strip view) is good to me, along with Mon Ami Gabi in Paris.", "Never again. Chef brought strawberries and drop it on the floor. Picked it up and places it back on the display. Gross!!", "I was at the buchannal for lunch this Monday and the wife and I have a horrible case of food poisoning. The one dish we both share was the Pozole. If anyone else experienced this please post. What a horrible way to mess up Father's Day.", "They claim that this buffet won top awards for the past 2 years. Go anywhere but here unless you're willing to ruin the rest of your vacation. Besides being one of the most expensive buffets on the strip, don't be surprised if you become seriously ill for 2 months following this meal.\nThe management takes no responsibility for their improper treatment of the food they serve.\nWe witnessed the handling of raw food next to cooked food.\nWe were forced to spend the last 3 days of our vacation in our room, sick as dogs.\nWe are still sick, 2 months later, and our doctor now has us on massive dosages of Flagyl along with Cipro. These drugs are not easily tolerated and it should not be necessary to have to go through this.\nIf you had a similar experience please call (800) 696-6699 or their insurance campany @ (866) 446-1424. They are wise guys!!!!!! We would avoid this buffet at any cost.", "I really don't know what the hype is been here 3xs and each time it's just reg buffet food nothing special. Maybe the glass cup decor but it's just a reg buffet with nothing that stands out", "***This place doesn't deserve ANY star, but I'll put one on in order to complete the review***\n\nThis place is effen bullshit!!! They would schedule a reservation one minute before they close. We arrive there on time and they announce they cannot serve us. Their excuse is that it's a computer glitch and they are sorry they can't serve us. Since when do computer glitches make it the customers' fault? NOT OUR PROBLEM!!  Us customers schedule our time before and around the reservation. What is sad is that they can only comp for the next day.  How's about giving us a comp for 20 mins or our next Vegas visit?  Also adding insult to injury, we came at 9:59pm and Yelp says they close at 11:00pm!! WTF is that???\n\nThe food is maybe \"labeled\" the best buffet in Vegas but definitely the WORST customer service!!  All they can say is SORRY SORRY SORRY.  Call me a WAAAH-MBULANCE!  Sorry is never the customers fault!\n\nWhat a way to ruin the tail end of a Vegas vacation.", "I really want to like this place, but it was extremely disappointing. Maybe it was overhyped. The food was just okay, nothing sets it apart from other buffets. \n\nBased on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again.", "Not worth it anymore.  No tomahawk ribeye.  Raised prices.\nGot a rude host and meat carver one time.\n\nAnd the meat was terrible one out of the 3 visits.  Really dry prime rib.\n\nTacos were really good one visit.  And just okay the second visit.", "Overhyped! Seafood is good but meats are well done & full of fat/ grizzle. Dirty dipping cups stuck together. Serious lack of service - plate racks were left empty, drinks slow to be refilled & dirty plates stacking up at my table. Then they took our dirty plates & silverware! Took 5 mins to get us clean silverware. Won't go back.", "Biggest disappointment on our entire trip. Everything is so salty and/or has less than stellar taste. Some things were downright bad. The saddest thing was the quality of the seafood. I've had better at a Golden Corral ( and I don't like Golden Corral) . Service also took a long time to refill our empty drinks. Then the drink machine for my tea broke so I went most of the meal without a beverage. Only highlight: the desserts are pretty. At $56 per person, we definitely had buyer's remorse.", "Long lines! Pay extra and ditch the line", "It's really not worth coming here unless you can eat and enjoy seafood.\n\nI came here with 3 others, and only 1 of us could indulge freely in seafood. Nearly all the buffet dishes had \"too\" much of something. Too sweet, too salty, too greasy, too dry. Their pizza was disgustingly salty. How in the world do you fail a dish as basic as pizza? I've had better pizza at my college dining common lol. The thing I enjoyed most was their cold bean salad, which is kind of sad. On the bright side, their seafood is very fresh. I normally steer clear of seafood because it either gives me heartburn or makes me sick to my stomach, but I chanced one raw oyster and I was fine after.  \n\nOur server had an attitude and deliberately avoided cleaning our table. I'd see him pass by and eye the dishes that need to be taken away, and then walk over to another nearby table instead.\n\nWe came in at 10:30am and got to experience some lunch items at breakfast price. I was super disappointed to hear that the lamb doesn't come out until 3:00pm. But whatever because their prime rib had a tough texture and was salty so I doubt the lamb could be any better. I doubt I would ever come here again unless I'm not the one paying.", "The food was fresh, the selection was a bit narrow as far as buffets go. The flavors in my opinion were a bit muted. The seating was not great and a bit crowded. The dining area was immaculate and the service was great. Worth the price but not a wow for this diner.", "I frequently run to Vegas for a quick business retreat. I'm not part of the player club at Caesar cause I'm not the gambling type. But I just pay the $20 express fee. I usually eat as much steak and sausages I can. A long with the casual Asian food dishes. The servers are really prompt and always checking up on yiu. The cooks are busy cooking away. Not much to talk to, sometimes the chef cutting the steak or sausage would explain the meat choices other times it seem he is having a bad day and just want to leave already.\n\nI come here all the time when I head to vegas.", "This will only be the second time in the 5 years i have been on Yelp that I'm giving somewhere a 1 star review....thats how bad my experience was here. Do not waste your money on this buffet. We had not 1, but 2 bad experiences here! Let me break it down for you as i see it:\n\nQuality of food: 2-3 stars\nSelection of food: 2 stars\nAtmosphere: 4 stars\nCleanliness: 1 star\nManagement: ZERO (first zero I have ever given to a restaurant EVER)\n\nWe showed up for dinner on a Sunday evening for dinner at about 8:30pm. We were told by the hostess that they were at capacity and were not taking in any more customers until no sooner than 9:30. Me and my party decided to wait until 9:30 since it was raining and didn't feel like walking somewhere else. So at 9:10 my friend checks with the hostess to see if we can get in before 9:30. She says no we are still not letting people in and it will be no sooner than 9:30 before we can enter. Great, nothing wrong with that...as we are standing there waiting (no more than 2 mins later) as we are standing 40 feet away she starts letting people in! So my friend walks back over to see whats going on and she says \"Ok we will take you now.\" WTF!\n\nSo now we are in line, which starts after the hostess stand we wait another 10-15 mins to get up to the counter to pay. As we are paying they tell us that they will be pulling all the food off the serving stations @ 10:30pm. So we are like okay, no problem. We waited this long to eat, that still gives us about an hour to eat...no problem. So we pay and once again....we wait....in line....again. This time for another 10 mins. They are finally ready to seat us. While we are being shown to our table we notice that there is a HUGE line at the buffet inside the restaurant! The line had to have been another 15-20 mins long. After seeing the line we realized that there was no way we had time to stand in the line every time you wanted something from the main buffet station and still eat our food in what was now less than an hour from when they took the food away. Mind you this buffet with tax was costing us $58 per person. If this was the case they should not be letting more paying customers in.\n\nWe ask to speak with a manger and got our money refunded back to us and we leave....but we still haven't eaten and all the good restaurants in Vegas close at 10pm. We ended having to eat at some diner because we waited for so long and now nothing else was open. \n\nNext day....for some ungodly reason we attempt to go back, this time to their breakfast buffet. We arrive at 11:03am, they inform us that they are now serving the \"Lunch Buffet, breakfast buffet stopped at 11am sharp\" and that the price will now be $40 per person instead of $18 (i think). Whatever, it was after 11am so i'm not complaining.....HOWEVER....wait for it.....the party in line with us is PISSED! We can hear the guy complaining to a manger...\"we have been in line for over 20 mins and you wouldn't let us in! Now that it's 11:01 you are going to let us in just so you can charge us more money!\" I totally felt for this guy, i have no doubt that he was right. And they were a party of 7 so that's really a lot more money. And here's the kicker...they were still serving breakfast food for the duration of the time we were inside!\n\nSo now we get to the table, go get our plates and wait in the line for the main buffet station for about 15 mins to get up there and find that there really wasn't even a good selection. I think they had 3 different meats to choose from and no crab legs. They did however have Lobster corn chowder, so i got a bowl....it was cold. FML....\n\nThe whole experience was HORRIBLE...2 days prior we ate at the lunch buffet at Aria and it was awesome. All the prime rim, crab legs and sushi you could eat....and it was only $30 per person. Go there....go anywhere....just don't go to the buffet at Caesar's Palace. What a disappointment, prob the worst restaurant experience of my life.", "Though the food is good, we got here at 830, they close at 10 but are no longer taking anymore people. An hour and a half earlier than the actual closing time is absolutely ridiculous. Definitely points removed for that. If they wanted to close at 8:30, they should say they close at 8:30 not 10, false advertisement!!!", "$53 for Sunday dinner. I've been wanting to eat here and my family finally took me on my birthday. The only thing worth talking about was the lamb. It was amazing. Everything else was mediocre. No ones been posting recent photos of the food and I think after it was dubbed the #1 buffet in Vegas, it let go of itself. What happened to the French macaroons, crazy gelato flavors, fresh honey from the honeycomb and all the other goodies ppl have been boasting about? I feel hella cheated. As for the the chefs, I feel bad for them. Some ppl just don't have common sense. Idk how many times the chefs have told ppl to stop eating on the line and to take the plates with the food they literally transferred onto their personal plate via their hands. Smh* ppl!", "The buffet at Caesar Palace is kind of mediocre. I have heard raving reviews about the newly remodeled buffet and decided to try it out.\n\nCame here on Monday for their lunch buffet. The cost was 35.99 plus tax, which is typical of Vegas buffets. The selection of food was okay, but most of the food was lukewarm or dried out which is strange when the place was packed.  \n\nThe layout of the buffet was also strange as it snakes around and people just stay near the front where the seafood and meats are. The lines for the meats and tacos were long and people blocked the food near there so the baked potatoes and other foods near the area were untouched.  \nThe prime rib and brisket were overly salty but compared to everything else, it was decent.\nThe seafood was also decent and but the selection wasn't that great.\n\nOur server was also never around so there was always a lack of drinks. \n\nOverall. It was mediocre at best. Expectations were not met", "Horrible buffet. We went at 5 pm on a Sunday hoping to avoid a long line. We printed a ticket from the kiosk and had a 1 hour wait. \n\nOnce seated it took about 10 minutes for our server to take our drink order. Both of my kids ordered Dr Pepper. The server came back and said they don't have Dr Pepper and he brought root beer instead. \n\nFood selection isn't anything special. Very very long lines for each good station. I ate at the planet hollywood buffet last week and the crab legs there were much better quality. Nothing we ate was memorable. I don't feel like the selection was bigger than other strip buffets.\n\nService was awful. Our server never cleaned up our dirty plates and never refilled our drinks. Tables are very small and we were very cramped with all the dirty plates.\n\nThe dessert section had no plates so I had to go search some out. The desserts looked good, but lacked in taste. The macaroons had a jelly filling and I spit it out it was so bad. The ice cream melted before I got back to my table. The coconut macaroons felt like dough flavored with fake coconut. I tried several other desserts and nothing was good. I like to have a cup of coffee with my desserts at buffets but since our server was MIA I couldn't even ask for one.\n\nVery disappointed. Don't waste your time or money on this buffet.", "I would say that this place is impressive but then I'd be lying, the servers and hosts were very rude, we made reservations for 11:45 am and were told when we arrived that they don't take reservations and then we were  told they do, then they told us you we would be texted when your tables were ready, an hour  and a half go by,  and still no text, so then we go up and ask what's going on and we are told that we cannot sit together and that if we wanted tables together it was going to be an 18 % gratuity in addition to  the already 600$ bill for breakfast, being that we were a party of 11 that would normally make sense but being that this is a BUFFET,  we were not having it, when a manager finally came she was rude and unapologetic, and seemed to roll her eyes and just generally was very unprofessional, she told us basically she can't do anything, then rudely said I will get the general manager and he can explain it to you the same way I did and maybe you'll understand. Another  thing the subordinate manager said later on that was rude was when she had us being taken to our seats  she told the host to make sure she split us up,even after all the hassle of simply letting us sit together , so the general manager comes out and before he did they were telling us that even if we split up into two groups we'd still be charged gratuity and the tables wouldn't be close, finally we get sat and and the general manager was able to take off the gratuity and we got two tables and they were semi close. The food was great until a few hours later when my stomach was unsettled and I threw my 600$ meal up. Long story short, I would never return there and strongly advise others against it as well, the only reason it gets 2 stars is because the food was decent, service is terrible and aside from the general manager, management was very unprofessional.", "It's basically not worth the long waiting. It took me almost 90 min to get a table. The quality of food is less than average.", "Wait, wait, wait, and wait. Three hours of waiting time  to eat something here. What's the point of kiosk check in.  When your time is up, you wait on the line to pay, wait to be seated, wait to get your food.....\n\nThis is my last time coming here.", "Beware, DIMINISHING QUALITY coupled with increasing prices.  Utter disappointment.  Just finished dinner on Sunday night at $57 per head.  No king crab legs, only snow crab. Not to mention the most watery not sweet puny stone crab claws I've had.  My Gf said the oysters were too sandy so she had only one.  Dishes are not in individual portions like they were in the past but like all low quality buffetts, dishes sit in large vats getting mushy and overcooked. This effect made the clams and mussels all dried and rubbery. Crab croquettes and crab fried rice no longer available.  All corn and no lobster in lobster chowder. Carne asada tacos chewy and not even close to par with King Taco.  Real gelato no longer served but instead sub with super sweet cheap ice cream with fake plastic props in display case.  Total waste of money. Food was overall too salty (pho, bbq )or too sweet(ice cream). And really?! Displaying decorative seashells instead of awesome fresh seafood that used to be in the seafood station. Real gaudy.", "Terrible! They have the worst line management I have ever seen. Very disappointing experience for such a high price. Booo!!!!", "4 hr wait?!?  Hell no. Purchased the $20 express line only to be disappointed by the food sooner than later. Yes, the selection is quite expansive, but the quality and taste were subpar for Vegas standards. Dry meats, sushi with higher-than-normal rice ratios, and a Reno-esque seafood station...no thank you. However, the cheese and charcuterie section--props to that. I will not be back. Will be at Wicked Spoon or the Buffet at the Wynn instead.", "This place was so overrated. We went just for the experience because we were on vacation in Las Vegas. Compared to the other Las Vegas Buffets, this one is not worth waiting for and there are much better ones out there such as Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon. The wait when we got there to get our ticket was already overwhelming and that was just the beginning. The ticket for the approximate wait was 176 Minutes (3 Hours) but we waited anyways. FACT: You could pay $20 per person to cut to the front of the line. After that long 3- Hour wait, you need to wait once more but to pay for your meal for about an hour or two. It was very pricey ($300 for 4 People). After half a day's worth of waiting, my family and I were not even impressed. The food was typical Vegas food. Though I only give the overall food a 6/10, the dessert bar was what made it the real deal. I gave a 10/10 for the dessert's bar because of the variety and taste. TIP: Try the horchata (Mexican rice drink) in a bottle.", "Was so exited to come here for dinner, but after eating the food I must say it was overly hyped and not worth it! The food was either way too salty or over cooked, even the dessert was not that good. I won't be coming back here again.", "2.5 Stars\n\nAlthough they claim 500 items on the buffet most of it is crap.  The best thing in there was the smoked turkey breast.  I found the other meats fatty and no flavor.  The crab legs were okay, the are in pots and you have to ask for them.  The pizza and the meatballs were not good.\n\nThe oysters are opened but not cleaned or loosened up so the slide out, living in LA they do not seem that fresh either.\n\nFor over $50 it is just not worth it, it is just as good as Golden Corral. \n\nWe would not return.", "Pros: \nHuge selections. \nDessert was my favorite of all. \nServers were amazing.\n\n\nCons:\nLong line.\n\nOne bad thing on that day was a group of teenagers next to us of about 10 of them were so loud, obnoxious and they thought they were being funny at all.  Yes, you can have a good time but at the right place. This buffet is for family, couple, or for everyone who wants to savor the food selection and not feeling being on a frat house. They were lucky my stomach was bothering me at that time and don't feel like to confront them. Fortunately, the manager came over to them and explained to them to lower down their voices but that was after 2.5 hours. Heck, it wasn't a victory for all of the diners at that time.", "Don't believe the hype. I think this place is overrated, overpriced, and not worth the money. Two people would roughly cost almost $80. The selection here is no where near wicked spoon. Go elsewhere like to the cosmopolitan. I would even rank some other buffets way better than this one off the strip.", "The saving grace for this place is it's Kind Crab legs. If that goes away, I would not come here again.\n\nThe process to wait is absolutely horrific. They have a \"pre-sign up\" system and it tells you to come back at a certain time. The time it told my group to come back was in an hour and thirty minutes. I definitely did not expect to be seated immediately at the time the system told me to come back, but I also did not expect an additional 45 minutes to wait to be seated. What is the point of having this system when you're just going to have to wait AGAIN? It makes no sense. \n\nThe rest of the food was not amazing and didn't blow me away to justify the almost 2.5 hour wait.", "I am a regular to Vegas, 2-3x times a year, and have been Diamond with Caesars for years.  Can't say I was very impressed, and most of that hinged on one thing.  Not the food, not the drink service, but the staffing in terms of keeping the tables clear of dirty dishes.\n\n4 of us went on a busy Saturday night, naturally it was at capacity as would be expected. Got seated and every empty table we saw was stacked with dirty dishes.  At a $50+ price point for dinner, hire a few more bus staff.  We went up for a second round, came back to the table 10-15 minutes later (yes, buffet is that extensive) all the dirty dishes glasses, etc were right where we left them.  And no, they didn't have a good quantity of food or drink in them, they were clearly done with.  Again, at the price point of $50+  per head, in surroundings that reportedly made it the most expensive buffet to build in Vegas, is the expense to clear tables really that much?  Even the tables that had been vacant for 20 minutes were untouched.  That's a lot of lost revenue by not being able to seat new customers. (Did I mention it was $50+ apiece)?\n\nTo top it off, on the way out I saw a manager near the exit, and mentioned that while the food was good, they need more staff to keep the dining room clear.  His response, that there are plenty of staff, they're just union and lazy.  There's a sentiment for you. I wanted to reply back that perhaps it was more due to poor leadership, management, hiring practices, or just cutting corners on staffing...but restrained myself.  \n\nBottom line.  Go next door to Mirage.  Maybe the food isn't quite as high end (but still very good), but still very good, well staffed, clean, well organized, wine and beer included, and save yourself some money.", "I've been to this buffet a couple times.  I am not super impressed with this place. I feel the quality of food is lacking. The wait is almost always very long, although they recently implemented their texting method, which they didn't have when it opened. I hate the layout of the food here. Only good thing this place has is that they have a large variety of food and i like their fresh juices in the bottles.", "Overpriced low quality food.  For months I heard my friends tell me to go to The Bacchanel. I went there tonight and to be honest it didn't meet my expectations.  The Asian and Italian sections were simplistic. The Chinese food lacked flavor and it seemed I was eating food from any other China Express or food court restaurant.  The Japanese sushi rolls were not fresh and you could see it was low quality fish/crab. The Italian pizzas and pastas were nothing special. As far as the meats, the sausage was ok, but the lamb was so bad I spit it out (I wasn't the only one).  I did not try the American section as I was already dissapointed. I would definately not recommend you to stop by. I think you can eat much better food for the $126 I spend for two.", "I was so disappointed at this buffet. I don't eat seafood, so I can't speak for that. Very little choices and subpar quality for the price.", "this is my second time at bacchanal and I'm not sure what the hype is all about. the first time I came, I had a fantastic dinner at Picasso so I thought my palette was spoiled but this time I had a side by side comparison and I think wicked spoon has this beat hands down. my girl and I wasted so much food because it was too salty, and the meat was so overcooked.\n\nadd the long wait and expensive price and I'm probably never coming back to this buffet. they aren't going to hurt without my business but I can't take the hype anymore.", "This used to be one of my favorite buffets. Now the price is insane and the quality has gone down.  The layout is horrible with major choke points for the meat. I'm here now and have been in line for 15 min.  The buffet has many empty tables. I get the opion management no longer cares about the customer experience. I expect things to flow better for $57 a person with tax. I will say, the desserts look killer.", "From: ChefDan the FlavorKing\n\nWHY are these people rating this crappy buffet so high?!!!! Because it has snow crabs and shrimp on it?!! You are NOT going to get your moneys worth I promise!.....ain't gonna happen.\n\nONE STAR for the REALLY bad value, possibly two stars for the food.\n\n1. Stood in line for 30 minutes watching the ridiculous OTHER line in front of the seafood buffet.\n\n2. No King Crabs - They immediately run out at 7:00PM? and don't restock them.\nSnow crabs - they slice them in half while chilled - HINT - go to the Italian side and they have them properly hot.\n\n3. The rest of the seafood was a joke on each occasion...fake paella, fake ceviche, etc. Don't mind a fake version...just not a bad one.\n\n4. Miniature hotdogs, hamburgers, and baked potatoes. REALLY?\n\n5. Lastly a BBQ station, pizza station, and basically an uninspired dessert station. That's about it.\n\nOn the desserts, at least do people a reach-around and fake a bananas fosters or something tasty. We flame that on our own buffets and it blows peoples minds.\n\nSUMMARY: $50 to stand in a bunch of lines and eat the above. Wow.", "We came here on a Friday about 4:30pm and there was no line!! I paid around $130.00 for 2 people because I figured it would be the same price as a steakhouse. (I found out later that the buffett was a bit more) If you are looking for steak you will disappointed like I was. I assumed that steak would be an option because of the pricing of the buffett but I was wrong. They had other choices like lamb, prime rib and chicken. You can get most of these choices at other buffets for much cheaper. \n\nI skipped over to the seafood which had Alaskan crab legs and rock crab claws. The Alaskan crab legs you can get at most Las Vegad buffets but the rock crab claws I haven't seen. The reason why I was dissatisfied is because they don't have crab claw crackers. I was told they had wooden mallots but I didn't want to go in that direction because we were seated too close to the other table. I didn't want to have crab shells flying all over the place so I just had the crab legs.\n\nI checked out the Asian station but I didn't find anything special. It was comparable to the Rampart Casino Buffett ( which isn't saying much). The dessert bar had no real stand out items for me.  They had gelato and an assortment of pastries. They do have fresh juices though but I didn't try any of them. \n\nIt is a good buffet but it is overpriced for what it is. If you must try it to see for yourself then you should go but if there is a long line I would think twice.", "I have no idea how this buffet tastes because their system is awful. We showed up at 7:20 on a Sunday night to have time for a 10:00pm show at the same hotel. We had to put our name in a digitized system to come back and pay at 8:23 - the system absolutely was pointless. We waited until 8:40 to be told we wouldn't be seated until 9:15 most likely, and for a party of two there was nothing they could do. If they had said the wait would be an hour longer than our time to pay we wouldn't have wasted our time, but we ended up instead with a very irritating experience. 0 stars if it was possible for this.", "HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and MANAGEMENT SKILLS! I am an MBA and specialize in online marketing. They completely false advertise their prices on their website and on Yelp. When you confront them, they state that they are not the ones who post their menu and pricing info online- which is completely not true. They are rude to their customers and talk back to you when you confront them that they have the wrong pricing online. They false advertise and their manager Wolfe heisey is especially RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!! instead of being courteous and nicely responding to your concerns, he gives you a cocky attitude and treats you with disrespect. I am pregnant and should not be talked down to that way, very disgusting and not managerial behavior. Rather than being cocky, he should be courteous to any customer that approaches him. It was very disrespectful\nAnd harassing. Completely deserves ZERO stars for their poor customer service and rude behavior.", "Beware - gnats abound in this buffet. The presentation was unbelievable but when we settled in for desert the gnats attacked. Having spent over $100 for dinner for 2 I asked for a manager. This goon named Wolf came and said this has been a problem before but since we were onto desert there was nothing he would do for us. I contacted customer service after arriving home and while they were sympathetic all that was offered was a return visit. Since I was 2500 miles away I asked for something comparable in one of their locations closer to home and was ignored. No reply at all. Needless to say I will not be returning there or any of their other locations.  \nFollow up -  It took contacting their corporate office several times but eventually they did the right thing and gave me a full refund.", "The food is worth every penny!

It started with waiting for 30 minutes in line. The waiter only asked once what we want to drink. After that no show. The plates were almost never removed from our table. A lot of the food was blend, dried out or was sitting way to long. I was missing the special twist in the food. There was nothing special about it. One hour after eating there I am feeling somewhat sick. Spending 55 bucks for that? Never ever again. Go to the Wicked Spoon instead. Way better choice with the twist. Overall super disappointed.\nAddition: I am very sick after having eaten there. It was either the oyster or sushi. The entire night running fever, chills and very bad cramps. I will never ever go there again.", "Like any other buffet. Lots of variety to choose from, but food quality was not five stars worthy!", "More expensive than comparable buffets but they carry more variety. I think the seafood is grossly overrated by other reviewers, but a solid buffet nonetheless.", "A total disappointment!  Literally ate one bite of each dish hoping it wouldn't be a fail...but it was.\n\nThe food is DEFINITELY not worth the price that was paid.  Seafood was lackluster and had few options.  Crab was waterlogged (even the \"hot\" version was waterlogged).  \n\nThe meat carving section was not good.  BBQ ribs and brisket were waaaay too smokey.  The prime rib seemed like it was rushed through cooking and the person at that station did not know how to cut the meat properly (cutting it into weird chunks, instead of the typical slices).  \n\nThe rest of the hot foods were forgettable.  As mentioned earlier, you'll only have one bite of each dish and be disappointed. \n\nThe desserts were meh as well.  The only thing that WASN'T a total fail was the creme brulee.  Although if the only thing that was worth getting a second time (or taking a second bite of) was a small aluminum foil dish of creme brulee, that in itself is a fail.\n\nServers were nice, but inattentive.  Water glasses were empty for the majority of the meal and it took a long time to get ahold of anyone.\n\n\n\nWound up going to Wicked Spoon two nights later and was totally satisfied there.", "Check out these pics! I still can't stop thinking about this damn buffet! Can't wait to get back to Vegas just to eat here again!", "Brought the boyfriend here today for his belated birthday feast. We got there right before 1000am and didn't have to wait. Wonderful! It's $43.99 w/ TR card for adults and $24.99 for children. I wish the age for paying children was 5 years old. My daughter is 4 and although I paid for her, she barely ate! All she had was 1/2 a juice and 1/4 of a char Sui bao. I should've called to see what their seafood selection was for Sunday brunch. Unfortunately there were no oysters, which is what he really wanted. The crab legs had to do! Overall the food was good. Decent selection, but for the price I think it's better to come for dinner. As with most buffets we've been to there are always a few items that have been out too long. I don't remember our servers name, but he was ok. Not the worst and not the best. He couldn't get our drink order- 2 Reg coffees, 1 decaf and 4 waters. We got the 2 coffees and 3 waters. Then when we asked for the decaf, we also had to ask for a cup. It wasn't even busy yet either. Oh well, at leas he asked if we were done with our plates instead of just taking them.", "Was so excited to eat here but was very disappointed with their king crab legs because it was tooo salty... Couldnt eat as much as i thought due to the saltyness but their dessert, oysters, shrimps, tacos, and sliders were the only things that is worth going for.

We went at 5:30pm on a Thursday and just zipped right in. In fact, this was our first night/restaurant in Vegas and I was so excited to try this place out! The food was really good! The standout was definitely the lambchop and brisket.

This was my anniversary trip with my hubs which I had been planning for months which has now been ruined. My conclusion is it was either the crab legs or the seafood that put me in this state because my husband is fine, but he didn't eat anything that came from the ocean. \n\nSo, go to this buffet because I know you will, I'd be surprised if my review stopped you but think twice about eating anything that was living underwater.

When you first sign in with their kiosk system (we checked in around 4:30PM), you get a ticket stating your wait time (mine was 154 minutes) and the time you should come back to the line to pay and get in (8:09PM for us).  We came back at 8PM to find out we have to wait another 2 hours in line to pay and get in.  I asked the staff what was the point of kiosk check in system, and he told me I am supposed to wait 154 minutes from 8:09PM according to my ticket.  huh? The restaurant closes at 10PM, so I am not sure how that would work...  We ended up going to Wicked Spoon (no line) and ate there promptly.  While we were eating, i got a text from Bacchanal (8:49PM) telling me I am almost at the front of the line and they will hold my spot for 15min.  Even if we weren't at another restaurant, I don't think I could trust their system to risk walking down there for another 30min to find out we have to wait another 2 hours or so.

Memorable were the charcuterie selection of meats and cheeses (some fresh baked baguette would be good there).  Truffled scallop potatoes. Pizza and Asian selections were good. Eggs Benedict had no flavor at all. \n\nThe less than good:  sorry guys, the dessert selection sucks.

There was nothing else that really stood out. The sushi rolls were blah. Soups were salty. Mac and cheese lacked flavor. Baked chicken was undercooked and very pink inside.The oysters (Blue Point) were pathetic. What are they doing? Shucking them and putting the leanest ones out there? It looked that way compared to the Blue Point oysters that we enjoyed at another hotel. \n\nAlso, the service was horrible. The excuse was that they were understaffed that day. We waited 15 minutes to get sodas, and never saw anyone offer a refill during our visit. Unacceptable. This is the world famous Caesar's Palace on the Las Vegas Strip.

We arrived around 4:30pm and printed a ticket that estimated our seating time for 6:13pm. The text message I received confirmed our estimated seating time and said that I would be receiving a text several minutes before seating. By 6:20pm, the gf and I were starving and decided to show up and ask about our seating. I asked one of the staff members (buff dude with no hair) where to check-in, and he had the worst attitude you could imagine.\n\nThis guy sounded miserable. I'm sure he was just annoyed by people asking him questions, but isn't that his job? I mean he just stands there, so what else is he getting paid to do? He didn't even let me finish and replied, \"just wait in that line\" as he lazily pointed to the line to check in. His words trailed off, almost as if he had fallen asleep while talking to me. \n\nI wait in that line another hour before reaching Vesna. She was just as bad as the bald guy. I asked if there was a problem with seating since I never received a text message to return for seating. This was around 7:30 now - over an hour past our estimated seating time. She said, \"Yeah, we're not sending text messages today.\" WHAAAT?! I got the first text message. Why the hell are you not sending the second? She said \"We are busy. It's the holidays.\" It's supposed to be an automated system! Why are you telling people to wait for a text that never comes? This is ridiculous! Never an apology or an ounce of sympathy. She just said \"everyone else is waiting too!\" My point was that they should not be telling people to wait for a text if it wasn't going to come. Also, the estimated seating time just means you need to come back to wait longer. This defeats the purpose of having the automated system. It was a little past 8:30pm when we finally sat down. Yup. 4 hour wait.\n\nThe only Reason I am leaving 3 stars is cause the food was good. Some of the meats were over-cooked and over-seasoned, but other than that, the selection was awesome and our server was great. He made sure our drinks were never empty. The \"holiday dinner\" seemed to be almost identical to their regular menu. It just cost a bit more. It was $56.99. If you include tax and tip, you're looking at over $70-something per person. They say you can skip the line for another $25, but really, you're just waiting in a shorter line (with all the people that pay extra).", "Well I never expected to give this buffet a bad review but my experience going to try it did not work out as I had hoped or expected.  It was a weeknight at 8:30pm when we got there with a party of three.  The line was long, just passed the first hostess stand.  I went to the kiosk to \"put our name in\" and it said to come back at 9pm.  We got in the line that wasn't moving and the host lady came through the line looking at everyone's ticket.  When she got to us she told us to get out of line and come back at 9pm.  That doesn't make sense because by the time we would pay it would have been at least 9pm.  AND the couple in front us had a ticket that said 8:55pm.  So she asked us to get out of line when the people in front of us has a ticket with a 5 minute difference but they were ok.  The lady was so rude, she was short, older, with short gray hair.  We were so disgusted by her rudeness that we left and didn't even eat there.  When you are asking people to pay almost $60 for a buffet you should at least treat them nicely.", "No matter what time you come here you have to wait at least 3 hours...........but if you pay extra 25 dollars you only need to wait about a hour........ so weird , won't come back anymore........ by the way , the food are just so so too", "Went for the holiday dinner for the first time at Bacchanal Buffet due to hearing all the hype.\n\nThe ticket system says they'll reserve you a time to come back, and they'll text you. Minimum wait time was 2-3 hours when we went, but expect to wait for another hour in line once you've been texted.\n\nThe advertised \"King Crab\" legs were simply snow crabs, which was much lower quality. Oysters ran out quick and a bunch of people were being sent back and forth between stations, a lot of guests were complaining to staff about this.\n\nThe Mexican station had ice cold tacos and other soggy  plates, which no one bringing out fresh dishes.\n\nSushi consisted of hard rice and stale tasting fish for the nigriri.\n\nI would advise all to stay away from the \"Vietnamese Pho\" and Udon, as both smelled extremely foul and toxic, similar to industrial chemicals. I didn't think either soup bases can turn out so bad.\n\nNot worth the $60 per person, very few items were edible, let alone \"good\".", "Not worth the wait! Over 6 hour wait time. Lol. The food is really good, but it is taking longer to get seated. We checked in at 3:45pm on Friday and the estimated seating time was at 10:37pm. They close at 10pm!! The self check-in is useless. When they text you to come in, you still have to wait at least another hour just to pay and get seated. Dinner starts at 3pm. So check in 3-5 hours earlier in a Friday.", "They kick ppls out of the line becoz we don't have enough ppls at the middle of the line. The servants have very bad attitude too.", "Getting straight to the point, today's meal at the prominent Bacchanal Buffet was absolutely terrible. \n\n1. As you may have heard from previous reviews, the ticket that you receive upon reaching the restaurant does absolutely nothing for the wait time. The \"text\" that they were supposed to send to notify us of when we were supposed to be at the restaurant did not arrive and was a complete waste of time. Even though we arrived at the restaurant earlier than others to receive this ticket, those who received the ticket after us were somehow able to be seated before us, thus making the ticket very much useless. After being presented the ticket, the woman in front, as well as the ticket, very clearly stated that we were to come back at that specific time after receiving the text message to be seated. Fair enough. After wandering the streets of Las Vegas for almost 4 hours, which was apparently the wait time for the restaurant, we returned to the buffet, only to find the huge line awaiting us, not to mention that we never received any form of message from the business. Convinced that we were able to get in sooner because of the ticket, we asked the same lady in front and she just quickly pointed us to the back of the line and left. Still utterly confused, we asked around only to understand that the ticket was not a pass to be seated earlier, but just a piece of paper to show that we were eligible to get in, meaning that we still needed to wait in line to be seated. We then waited in the never-moving line for about 1.5-2 hours before finally being able to see the inside of the restaurant. It was around 9:30 or so and with still so many people behind us and the restaurant closing in about half an hour, we were at our limits. What should have been a relaxing dinner with family was rushed and uncomfortable for everyone. Technically, the time we spent waiting for the text, a thorough explanation, and the line was actually around 6 hours, which is a huge amount of time for the quality of food that was served there. Not satisfied at all. \n\n2. After finally being seated half an hour before the advertised closing time, we immediately went to get food, filling our plates with as much as we could take, expecting the food to be absolutely delicious, but sadly we were once again very wrong. Throughout the meal, the food was at most mediocre and most likely able to be bought at any restaurant in our home town, making us instantly regret our decision to spend more than $200 on the place. A lot of the food tasted overcooked, burnt, and almost vomit-worthy. After barely eating anything and having spent a tremendous amount of money, we just left, with still many people left eating/unseated. I would have described the food there to be leftovers from a trashy restaurant if I did not know where it actually came from, though the argument still stands. \n\nIt's overrated and the management for crowds sucks. Don't go here.", "Waited 6 hours. Never got the text. Came in at 9:50pm. Said computer system doesn't work and too bad and you have one-half hour to eat. Horrible and what a waste of time.", "The service, it's like omg, I checked in at 4:24 and the ticket said we can come back at 8:20, then I asked the server if we can just leave and come back, she said of course we can, so me and my girlfriend left to shop and came back at 8:30, I asked the server where do we check in, she said we have get wait in line which we take another two hours she said, what the fuck is the point of letting customers getting the ticket? Even the Canadian old couple was forced to get back in line, and same as many other people, sincerely, Cesar needs to change the procedure.", "Complete and utter disaster with the line we waited for two hours and they kicked us out of the line because the whole party wasn't present. The manager was extremely rude. She did not even apologize. We ended up not going at all. DONT GO HERE. NOT WORTH IT", "Extreme long wait but you can pay extra $25 to cut in line. Else u need to get a number then come back at a given time and LINE UP for another 45 more minutes to pay and get in.  No kidding. \nFood was good but for some $50 was expensive.  I heard its the number 1 buffet in Vegas so at least i gave it a try.", "The food may be great but the service is the absolute worst. Don't know if it was because I went during the holiday season or not but I have never dealt with such an unprofessional business/management. \n\nThe food is delicious but for the wait, price, and customer service combined is not worth the experience. The customer service itself is shit and do not expect to eat for at least 3+ hours with rude workers and irrational policies. \n\nTheir 'policy' of the whole party having to be there in the entire duration of 3-4 hours of the line is bullshit.\n\nI came here once with a party of 4 about a year ago during the summer and the food was great but the wait was.. insanely long and not worth it.\n\nThe second time I came with a party of 11, called twice to the front desk of Caesar's Palace AND got directed to the front desk of the Bacchanal Buffet to make sure that the whole party did not have to be there, and they both confirmed that it is completely fine.\nAfter waiting in the line for 1+ hours, the so called manager named Melissa comes up to us and rudely says that we may not stand in the line unless our whole party is here. \nEven after arguing with her, and questioning the existence of the policy, she rudely interrupted us every time to say there was nothing she could do about it. She was extremely rude and did not know how to apologize. \nAsked if I could talk to the head manager, she rudely cuts me off and claims that she IS the manager in a derogatory tone.\n\nNot only is this place not worth the wait, but it is also not worth losing your sanity.", "place is still very busy!! arrive early for dinner\n\nunfortunately from my recent vist some of the food quality has declined MAINLY the MEAT section the lamb chops tasted like shit the ribs tasted like salt on a bone!!! WTF everything else was good as i remembered but whats going on at that section!?!?\n\nthey need to fire whoever is preparing/cooking that meat, im more angry that they are making meat that taste like crap and its being thrown out cause its not edible!!!!\n\nand they need more people clearing tables still slow and nearly non existent!\n\nstill my go to buffet in LV doh.", "I'll be honest. This was my FAVORITE buffet up until this past weekend. We got ready EXTRA early and got there at 10AM to our early check-in receipt from the machine. Our ticket said: APPROXIMATE CHECK IN TIME WILL BE 11:05AM and that we'd get a text a few minutes before... We never got a text and when we went up to the line, they made us stand in line ANYWAY. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THEM HAVING THAT DUMB MACHINE THERE IF WE HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE?? THEY SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS saying EVEN IF YOU HAVE THIS TICKET YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.  Our group was trying to be understanding and saying well it IS Christmas and they're extremely busy. THAT wasn't the part that pissed us off. We waited over 2 hours IN LINE (NOT counting the 1 hour we spent near by waiting for our TEXT that we never GOT) and when we got to the front of the line, we stopped moving up for over 30 minutes because they started letting this OTHER line ahead of us. I guess these people were the 7-star guests, or guests that paid extra. WHY WOULDNT YOU JUST DO A SEPARATE ENTRANCE FOR THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF SHOVING THEM IN FRONT OF US WHILE WE STAND THERE WATCHING THIS HAPPEN?? IS THAT YOUR WAY OF ADVERTISING - IF YOU WANT TO GET IN, THEN PAY EXTRA PER PERSON? ALSO there were some guests that started complaining and screaming so THEY were ALSO shoved in front of us. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT... PATIENT guests like US get punished and stuck in line, while SCREAMING guests get put in front of the line... WHAT AN AWESOME management system  you got there. We got so fed up and left to eat at Spago - which turned out to be better.  EVEN THOUGH this WAS my favorite buffet EVER, I probably won't go back since they have the worst management/customer service ever. I just felt bad because I was the only one that has been to this buffet out of our group and the whole trip, I hyped this place up SO much til we got there. In the end, my family never got to try this place and everyone left angry.", "The reviews are on point in describing this buffet as one of the most exquisite on quality dishes, fresh ingredients, and overall great taste. My overall dissatisfaction was in how disrespected we were by the staff who would not empathize with us and other families with children. After 90 minutes we were repeatedly told we had a two hour limit. We explained that our 8 month old had to be changed and nursed during the meal and still, were harassed by one of the leads. My wife was not allowed to finish her dessert after spending one hour addressing the needs of our little ones. We are very upset given the advanced planning we made to get a reasonably dine time at the kiosk. The staff need greater training and might need a protocol to asses each family's circumstances prior to harassing guests. We felt discriminated, rushed, ridiculed by staff who stared and spoke about us from a short distance. Sadly this was also my birthday dinner.", "So many frustrating things with this buffet. The stars are due to the service all together. \n\nTicket/line - Supposedly, you come and get a ticket and then come back at your time to check in and pay. Sounds easy and painless? Think again. Our ticket for four said 2:01pm return time. We get a confirmation text. Cool. BUT we come back and I ask one of the workers where I go to check in and pay and she said...WAIT IN THIS LINE. The line was like wrapped that was about a 1-2 hour wait. I thought you just get a ticket a check in? Nope! I asked that lady what the point of the ticket was and she had no answer for me. She simply said it is not working. NO DUH! So we literally waited in line for another hour and 15 minutes. We got excited after paying but what happens next? Yet another line!! We had to wait another 15 minutes to get a table!!! We saw so many open tables but no one was cleaning it up. We all skipped lunch for this and were all starving unhappy people.\n\nSERVICE - We all got our table and grabbed our plates of food. Oh look! No utensils. So we ask our server for napkins and utensils. He brings back two napkins for a party of four with a pile of utensils and tosses it on the table and tends to another group. Umm thanks?? He gave me three forks and I nicely asked for a knife. He said \"what do you want. We are out of everything\". RUDE. \n\nFOOD - everything we had was good. Decent. Quality buffet food. Much better than their old one buffet. BUT the menu said they had waygu beef sliders. No where to be found.\n\nI have a bad taste now when it comes to this buffet. The staff was terrible. Lots of things were misleading. Thumbs down Caesar's Palace!", "Horrible and dishonest service! I ate\nhere before and decided to come\nback.\n\nThe wait time to get seated was 2 hours. After giving my cell phone I was texted confirmation with the expected seating time, 130 min later. When I finally showed up, I was told to wait in the line for another 1\nhour. Seriously!\nAfter speaking to the manager, it became\napparent that this is just how it is, and they\nmake it a policy. \nIf you are not from the US and this is the first time you are going to all you can eat \nbuffet, I suppose any wait is fine. \nFor the rest if us, service is also \nimportant. Horrible-will not go back.", "If you choose this buffet to eat king crab, then you should find another buffet. This place is a true scam artist. Their KING CRAB PORTION is mix with snow crab and in fact 5/6 of it were snow crab legs.  \n\nThe hot or boil king crab is nasty. Some of it was still frozen eventhough they have soak in hot water.\n\nCustomer service was great. The place is pricy and the wait was very long. Overall i would not recommend this place.", "very good food quality, but limited variety", "So far my favorite buffet here in Las Vegas! If not M buffet!\nGreat food and service!", "The selection here is pretty decent. Their sushi station was sparse and lackadaisical. The cooked seafood station along with the carving stations were very well stocked. \n\nSlightly annoyed that there were bean sprout roots-- dirt and all in my ceviche. The server didn't even apologize. And my table was sticky and gross.", "It was a very disappointing experience to eat at this buffet. We waited for 102 minutes and paid $52 per person. The steak was the worst I had ever eaten across all American restaurants; it was hard to chew and the meat was over cooked. The sea food was horrible with only crab leg being ok. I even didn't want to try it is sushi and Asian food based on the visual impression that they were not fresh at all.\n\nOverall with the price tag of over $110 with taxes Caesars Palace buffet was not worthy either the length of wait time and seat environment. I am very surprised of the top rating it had at the website. It is absolutely misleading. Bad choice absolutely !", "I ate a dead fly salad today! Period \nWhen I was eating my salad , I saw something drop out of the salad from my mouth. when I looked at it, it was a fly! A dried fly!!! I asked for the manager and she just took away my dish!! What a nice restaurant. I can't imagine how do they prepare the food in the back!!!!\n\nEdited. \nAnother manager has contacted me earlier and applogize for the problem and she asked me to visit them again. I overrall i have good experience. I have change from one star to 4 stars.", "I gave this one star only because half is not an option...\nI was here a year ago and recommended this buffet to all my friends....my how things have changed in a year.\nWe waited a half an hour for their new \"speed seating\" system to put us at the head of the line, then waited another hour to pay and be seated..\nOnce we were seated there were so many people that there were now lines for every area of the buffet, and the seafood area nearly 30 minutes! The crab legs are smaller, lines are longer, and the desserts are less plentiful and uncreative.\nStreet tacos were the highlight, but for $65 a person, I can go to chipotle and have comparable food with plenty of cash left in my wallet.\nVery disappointed, we will stick with Wicked Spoon from now on... I recommend you all do the same!", "Pretty bad buffet for almost  $60 per person. We stand in line for almost 40 mintues. And the food is a totally disappointment. It's basic a seafood section plus a grill food section plus a cheap Chinese food section and some desert in the middle. I want my money back if I can. Wicked spoon is the way to go", "This place is over rated.  The line to pay and get in is crazy long and when you get into the buffet there are more lines (especially the seafood section) to get your food. The food wasn't even all that,  bad presentation,  mediocre in taste and on this occasion,  it made most of the people in our party run to the restroom (food poisoning, ahhhh). All for $55, what a bargain? Not. Perhaps the only good thing about it was the dessert bar,  but never again would I go to this buffet.", "Arrived with a party of 15.  Was told that the wait was less than an hour if we prepaid.  So we did.  Over a thousand bucks.  It took over two frkn hours to get a table.  Idiots run this place.  Fire the host staff.  Very unprofessional behavior.  While eating, we old retired wealthy farts decided to not gamble one penny at Caesars.  We spent the last four days of our trip in other casinos.  Fire the idiots in charge of this buffet, they are losing you big bucks in the casino.", "I think beachanel buffet is not that good. The food is ok!! The vegetable for salad is too dry and Asian food part is terrible.\nMoreover, the outlook of the dessert seems good but it wasn't.", "Buffets aren't really my thing, but in Vegas - why not? For $60, I really expected something amazing, but was really just a fancy Golden Corral. There was a big selection of seafood, but I was disappointed in the lack of red meat. No steak, Caesar? Also, the line to get in on a Saturday night was insane. We waited nearly an hour to be seated, and then every line for main courses were at least 20 people deep. Unless you think you can eat your money's worth in quantity, I'd recommend you skip Bacchanal and spend $60 bucks on a meal where the chef has actually touched your food.", "The most horrible experience at the checkin. They have this dinky idiotic machines outside to sign in. I was in line and was asked to sign in and a ticket was handed over to me (I will attach the image) stating that they will text me in 67 minutes. Well I had an appointment with apple and I walked all the way to the other side of the casino. Got a text ( will attach image) that I have 15 minutes to get back and pay otherwise I have to be at the back of the line. Got back to be told that I take my place back in the line; right behind the last person that entered before me. Just amazingly stupid. \n\nThey can have their food and shove it.", "Quality wise, this is probably the best buffet in Vegas. The line system is basically, first you go to their kiosk to get a time ticket. They offer you to jump the line for $25 pp but be warned that it's to jump only the regular paying line. You'll still have to stand in line for a seat which could take 20-45 minutes. They text you when it's time to get in the first line to pay. Then there's a 2nd line to get seated. We went for the beginning of dinner on a Sunday, 3pm. Got a 1 hour wait but we were staying at the hotel so we waited in our room. Total time for the table was about an hour. 2 rooms of food. Back room has mostly Asian and Italian. Note for those wanting crab legs, there's a lady near the pizzas serving warmed up crab legs so skip that crazy seafood line if that's what you're lining up for.", "This buffet was an amazing experience as advertised.it is upscale and the seafood and deserts are amazing.the only problem is the price is 53 dolars and its no more upscale jere than at the wynn or bellagio.", "I was unimpressed for the hefty price. Standouts: deliciously-seasoned fried chicken, smoky BBQ ribs, cheese and charcuterie, mini salads. Things that were really so-so: fishy raw oysters, bland and tough prime rib, weirdly sweet lamb chops, dry sashimi.", "This place has been on my radar for years and I finally came here for Lunch.  \n\nDisregard all the negative reviews.......If you want to eat at the best Buffet in Vegas (and possible the entire world) come to the Bacchanal.\n\n5 STARS!", "AAA+ for ambiance and presentation of food!!!  But once you come down from that visual overload and get down to eating, you will notice some discrepancies!  By this I mean, your eyes are sending signals to the brain of \"Omgosh!  Must try!\"  However, once you taste, your tongue and tummy may say, \"What?\"   I'm not saying it was really bad, just that the flavor wasn't always on point!   I will tell you that the pork belly, smoked salmon Vischaisse, red velvet bread pudding, and pot de creme with miso were INCREDLE!!!!\n\nAlso, enjoyed the fresh juicing carafes!", "Due to a very high review on Yelp, my friend and I decided to come here for dinner. We tried almost everything. Seafood is not very good and food is salty to me. But, deserts are good. \nPrice is $55 including tax on Friday (dinner)", "One of the worst meals I have had ever. Bland, cheap and just plain flavorless. Went at 830am for breakfast and had to wait almost 25 mins to get seated while there were only 3 people ahead of us and yes there were guests with status who got seated before us which is fine, but when there are 50 empty tables or more, there is no need to have a table of two wait for a table to open up. Seat them at a table for 4. Also unless you had status at casino it seemed you could not get a server to bring drinks! Sat at table 20 more minutes before we gave up and went to buffet to get food. Very poorly managed and we will never be back. I live near nyc and eat there often and this type of hype for this buffet does not even compare to the service you receive at a food cart in NYC. For 30 bucks each for breakfast we were very disappointed and had much better breakfast else ware. Avoid at all costs !", "This review is more for the staff than the food. The food was fine, but I think Wicked Spoon is a much nicer place to eat, this place felt a little worn out and the service was lack luster. \n\nMy main issue is that halfway through our meal, an elderly waitress came up to me (and a woman a few tables away from me) and told us individually that we weren't welcome to breastfeed our babies there. Neither her nor I were showing as much as an inch of skin and in fact I'm surprised she could even tell I was feeding my child as I was wearing an oversized black sweater.\n\nBoth the other woman and myself were so taken aback by it, it's never been an issue for either of us, myself in LA and her in Vancouver- neither of us had ever been reprimanded. We were just discreetly feeding our 8 month olds as mothers everywhere do.\n\nI felt so unwelcomed and when the manager, whom I asked to see, came over she didn't really have much to say aside from \"um, sorry?\". Barely an apology for making me so uncomfortable after spending a ton of money at their restaurant. \n\nSuper tacky and totally behind the times. And especially ironic in LAS VEGAS where there were scantily clad women all around us. \n\nBreastfeeding mothers are not welcome here and that's not a place I choose to support.", "I wasn't overly impressed by this place. I went in using the groupon for their breakfast and they ended up charging us tax on the full normal price, why??? Our groupon was $60 but they taxed us on $160, the full price?? Again idk what the hell was going on but this place was just not worth it to me. The only upside was the unlimited mimosas so I made sure I got my money's worth. A deal that supposed to cost 25 a person ended up as 45, so pretty much you're paying the full normal price just to get free cheap alcohol. Also it was breakfast only so the food was very mediocre. I don't blame groupon at all because this was simply the misleading doings of baccanal's buffet. If I'm gonna spend $30+ on a meal again, i'll do it at all you can eat sushi. Not for some salad, few claws, eggs, and toast.. Maybe i'll come back when they have a real deal that is not misleading during their dinner times? But until then, I don't think i'll ever return, it's just not worth the money at all.", "Overrated!\n\nI'm not sure why hordes of people would be willing to line up for 2+ hours... I think it's kind of expensive for mediocre food/service. There is a wide variety of food, but it's really a typical Las Vegas spread. Seafood, American, Asian-American, Desserts, Pizza, etc. It was cool to see them put out Ice Cream mochi, but I was a bit disappointed when the dessert chef was unwrapping them from a Costco bulk size box at the dessert station. \n\nOverall, I think this place is okay. Food is decent, but waiting 2+ hours is ridiculous. They do have a paging system, but it's very inaccurate (probably because they want you to gamble).", "Do not expect too much on those food, services are extremely bad, we requested for exchange the table coz that area is too dark, the front desk lady said ok, I will give you ONLY one more chance to exchange the seat. Paying $40 for lunch is totally not worth it with that kind of services.", "I have been here 2 times. \n\nThe first time was amazing. Prime rib, seafood, cooked foods, desserts, etc. 5 star. \n\nI went this last weekend, and it was not good. The prime rib was very low quality. The prime rib was more along the lines of Hometown Buffet level (not that Hometown is bad, but it costs 1/10 the price, so adjust your standards accordingly). \n\nThe sushi section was very low quality. For $60 dollars you expect their sushi section to be much better. \n\nAlso the line system is very long and annoying, with a number system that is just to get you in line. \n\nConsidering the very high price ($60) and the long wait (1 to 2 hours) it deserves 1 star. \n\nIf this place was $20 with a better line system I would rate this 5 stars.", "Not what it use to be. My wife and I tried this buffet when it first opened. It was so much better than what it replaced. After a year, we decided to go again. This time we were very disappointed. It just wasn't as good Also, we noticed that there was no hot shrimp in the entire buffet - no fried, no scampie, no casserole - NO SHRIMP! They only had the cold shrimp for shrimp cocktails. You may not think this is a big deal, but when shrimp is your favorite food, you are there on a Friday night, and you ALWAYS get it in almost every other buffet, this is a bummer.", "I have paid 81$ for a brunch(25$ to skip waiting) food is not good, not the quality for 50$! Worse than most buffet I have ever had. Disappointing at all!!", "It's not that great.  You wait in a long line to get to the place where you pay for the buffet, then you wait a bunch more time in a second line to finally get to the front where you will finally get assigned a table, then you wait in a long crazy line to get to the carving station.  It was a total ordeal from start to finish.  If you enjoy long long waits then this place is totally the place for you.  \n\nAfter I finally got in I was not impressed by the selection.  The way the food stations where laid out seemed haphazard and unorganized.  I'm not a huge meat eater so if you are really into carne then maybe it's worth the massive wait times.  It was not for me.  I wished I had gone to the Aria buffet that I check out the day before.  It looked very good and there was no lines to speak of. \n\nThe one upside was the deserts were pretty good.\n\nI will NEVER go back.  It cost me $57 to battle in lines for over an hour. I felt like I was in a mad-max movie, \"buffet dome.\"   I could have spent that kinda of cash on something really good!\n\nI believe that the #1 rating is a huge hype job by Caesars.  There are posters and signs on every taxi in town about this underwhelming buffet.  Once again the reality of Vegas doesn't meet the hyper-hype.  \n\nIf your idea of a great night out is to standing in long lines over and over with a bunch of crabby hungry people and to have to dash around goofy obnoxious people battling to get food, your home!\n\nThe freaking carving station had a huge line that was in the way of getting to a lot of other dishes unless you got in that stupid slow moving line, even if all you wanted was a non-carving item like baked beans or corn on the cobb.  It was redonkulus.   They need to have more then one meat carving station away from the other dishes.\n\nI WILL NOT BE BACK.  I WAS ROBBED OF AT LEAST 40 OF MY 57 BUCKS I SPENT ON THIS BUFFET OF STANDING IN LINE AFTER LINE AFTER LINE.\n\nBut if you are a total lemming and tend to fall for all the hype, then totally, you should go for it.", "What's not to love? We usually don't do buffets as many lack quality of food. This place did not disappoint! Every dish was unique and flavorful. Unlimited mimosas were a plus! Will def visit on our next trip!", "Will never come here again is very outdated andThe food is not that great for the price was a pain in the butt he get in any in the chairs are so uncomfortable", "Over priced and over rated. Paid $25 extra per person to skip to the front of the line and still ended up waiting for 2 hours. Better than 99% of other buffet places but not worth the wait.

Probably. Worth $50/person? Not really.\n\nThe Good:\n-Prime rib, beef brisket and sausages. Genuine restaurant quality, albeit still not near the best I've had.\n-Small plates. Lots of items like salads, tofu, fish, etc as well as some creative dishes come in small individually presented plates/bowls and most were good.\n-Boiled crab legs. Randomly located at the Italian food station. Look for 4 big pots and you gotta ask the chef to get them for you.\n-Charcuterie. Not an expert but it all tasted fine to me.\n-Sliders. Better than White Castle at least.\n-Pizza. The only buffet pizza I've ever had that doesn't taste like it came from a hospital cafeteria\n-Jucies. 6 varieties, all were good. \n-Most desserts, in general. Huge variety. Only tried maybe 1/3rd because I got too full but most were good.\n-Electronic kiosk that will text you when it's time to line up.\n-Overall restaurant decor.\n-Food presentation and sheer variety.\n-Service. Frequent water refills and nearly every time I got up to get more food by the time I got back the old plates were cleared out.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Cold crab legs. Way too salty.\n-Lamb chops. Overcooked.\n-Macarons. Many different colors, all taste the same.\n-Ethnic food section. Come on, it's a $50 buffet, you gonna fill yourself up with tacos and fried rice?\n-Too many of the seafood items were shrimp.\n-Sushi. Poor selection and worse than what you'd get at a $20 sushi buffet.\n\nThe Ugly:\n-BBQ ribs. Worst I've ever had, by a long shot. \n-Buffalo wings. Tough and dry. Worse than grocery store wings.\n-Waffle fries. Stale and flavorless. Going from Chick-fil-A to this is like going from Caesar's Palace to Circus Circus.\n-Ramen. Broth is just awful, noodles too tough.\n-Crawfish. Absurdly spicy.\n\n\nOverall - 3.5. Rounded down because I can't honestly recommend Bacchanal unless you really love buffets.", "Don't waste your time waiting in line! Was sadly disappointed with this vegas buffet. Best dishes were the Asian section and desserts. No variety in the Mexican food section, bland crawfish, and where was the Indian food? Go to the Wynn buffet instead.", "It's among the better buffets but still lacking in taste. The choices are varied but not vast. Crab legs and oyster and oyster shooters makes it better than others. Still nothing notable, would recommend Wicked Spoon instead if price is a factor (it's cheaper by $10).", "The alaskan king crab i got was literally frozen. It felt like i was eating crushed ice. The line to get in was disorganized and long. The lines within the buffet itself were also long. The prime rib was too rare. The lamb was cold. The whole restaurant was freezing. Took forever to get somebody to get me something to drink. The oysters had to be pried out with a fork instead of just slurped down. The tables and chairs look like ugly furniture from criagslist i would never buy. Ive been to rio, aria, wynn etc and this was my worst experience. Two stars because im in a good mood after 18oz of Fat Tuesdays.", "Worst customer service Ever.\n\nNot a great contender for food either they boat at being the biggest buffet in vegas but a lot of the food is the same thing done different ways which doesn't take any effort or creativity.. 8 different types of French fries.. French fries at a buffet if I wanted all you can eat French fries I would go to red robin and pay a fraction of the price... Give me potatoes in a way I can't get at a freaking drive thru you lazy idiots..", "Not worth the money.....came for the oysters... and they looked old and probably will get us sick so did not touch any of it. \nWill just stick to the buffet in Bellagio next time.", "Okay so I'm writing this sitting here in the buffet. That's how bad this is. Really disappointed with the food selection. Way too bland and so far the only thing that has been good was a Strawberry cupcake I just devoured. Not to mention I nearly had a heart attack when I had to pay $40 just for me! Way overpriced for the quality of food. Service was great which is why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1. Food = NO!", "I was really looking forward to coming here.  I am not a fan of buffets, but with the reviews this place had received I was really looking forward to eating.\n\nMy complaint is not about the food.  The food was good.  It was decent, not over the top because obviously it is z buffet.\n\nMy complaint lies in the manner my guests and me were seated.  We were given a table to the very back of the establishment.  When we asked if we could be up closer we were told that was not possible.  When we asked why we were told that it was due to casino rules. \n\nAfter paying a rather large sum for dinner it was really not acceptable to not be able to allow us to change to a nicer table, especially when there were many available.  This was not a case of discrimination but rather a case of over elitism.\n\nI will not return and neither will my dinner guests.", "I really don't see the hype. Wicked spoon is better and cheaper. I wouldn't go back again.", "I don't get the high praise for Bacchanal because I walked away from it feeling pretty ripped off. The food was good but not exceptional and the service was absolutely terrible for the price point.  You practically have to tackle a server to get a refill on your mimosa or your coffee (which was burnt) and the buffet is set up so terribly that you end up spending an obnoxious amount of time waiting in line.  Definitely would not go back nor would I ever recommend anyone else to do so.  Only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the desserts were good and I'm permitting a small allowance for the level of service because the service in Vegas generally sucks everywhere.", "I mean it's GOOD, but it's not life changing or anything.   The wait is obnoxious, someone taking your picture as you walk in is also obnoxious, the lines to get to the food are obnoxious, and the way the whole buffet is spread out is obnoxious.  \n\nThat said, the pork belly, crab legs, dim sum, and prime rib were all excellent.", "We planned a whole day around going here because of all the hype.\n\nAfter checking in, we were told we would be texted when it was our turn. In an hour or so we got a text \"please return to the hostess. Expect a wait.\" We got back and had to wait another 30+ minutes to pay and get seated. That was annoying and sort of defeated the point of early check in. Plus we were losing money quickly at Craps so by pulling us away the casino probably lost money. I guess that's good for us.\n\nThe buffet was impressive. I think it may have just been over hyped. All sorts of Asian (Chinese, Thai, Korean, Japanese)... An impressive cheese platter... Street Tacos made to order... A seafood buffet that would have sufficed on its own at most places... And plenty more. most of The food was good, but much of it wasn't great. And there wasn't a ton of special items (like at Cosmo where we all tried bone marrow for the first time, even if I didn't like it). There's was just LOTS of more generic food. I also thought the meat carving station wasn't as good as other vegas buffets as everything was dry. Maybe I was just buffeted out but I like to eat so I'm not sure that's the case. \n\nDessert was good. Crepes made to order. When they didn't have lemon the chef made sure to get it for us. Cake pops, gelato, and more. Even taffy! Dessert was the winner at this sadly over hyped (think of how good a meal $63 can buy you) buffet.", "Meh, overrated. We went here because of all the hoopla surrounding it. I could take it or leave it. First of all, you check in at the kiosk and still wait on line. I think if you buy a buffet pass, your on an express line. Long line for the crab legs/seafood. It wasn't anything special about this buffet except it was pricier than most.", "The receptionist on the phone said they have king crab legs so I rushed over there, turned out to be there was NO king crab legs at all, it was just pure regular crab legs.\n\nOh well, I was drunk anyways, 4 stars it is!", "Overrated. It's the same as any other buffet. Nothing special. Food is ok but not great.", "The buffet was good but not the best the sea food was alright but no lobster and the crab was nothing amazing. I give it a three because for the price I expected more, honestly for that much I would have rather spent it at a steak house on a good steak from a place that I know would make a nice cut of meats. The best part of the buffet was the dim sum and the Chinese food the American food was standard and the prime rib wasn't fantastic", "If I created a problem and then charged you to solve it, what would you call me? \n\nAnswer: the government or bacchanal\n\nFight the man!", "If Bacchanal is one of the best buffet in Las Vegas , then I may never eat at another Vegas casino buffet in the future. Bacchanal's food quality and selections are inversely correlated . The service was not memorable. It was a Disappointing dining experience overall. Perhaps the pressure to meet the buffet's operating budget and metrics has lead to its decline in food quality and consumer's dining value. Unfortunately, skimping on quality leads to the lost of returning diners and poor word of mouth...both of which actually translate into the loss of potential revenue and brand reputation in the long run. It is would have been somewhat forgivable had the lesser quality and less-expensive ingredients  been creatively and innovatively transformed into better dishes. Sadly this was not the case. Ultimately, Bacchanal's quality and service does not justify its $70 per person price point. Dining at Bacchanal left me feeling disappointed with the LV buffet dining experience and cheated as a patron.", "Golden Corral buffet would have been better.. Seriously NOT worth the $50 bucks a plate.  Very disappointed in the quality.  While the offerings were varied and there were special items like duck, it just simply wasn't good.  And I'm not a picky eater and am very forgiving... but in this case, yuck.  I feel like I wasted my money.", "Save your money and go to the Wynn!!! The food is pretty much the same or better over there. We waited an hour to check in with the host only to be directed to to wait in another line for another 30 minutes to pay $120 for two people then move to another line and waited another 15 mins. I get they're busy, but they have this service if you pay extra they seat you right away which is fine but there is no special line for it and when you've been waiting over an hour it's annoying. Then the service wasn't great. Like their employees were over worked and exhausted. Just not a good experience. Will NOT be coming back.", "This buffet is really a \"must try\", even with its crazy price tag and even crazier wait time (where you take, essentially, a \"number in line\" ticket with a return time plus additional hours of waiting in line).\nThe price is the highest I've come across at about $70/person (during holidays). \nThe choices...oh my...where do I start! TONS of things to try and most are exquisitely pre-plated. I've tried every single item (not getting the samething twice and some only a single bite) and I was stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey.\nThe service was superb. Clearing plates and refills without us asking, whaaat?! But honestly, I wasn't expecting anything less.\n\nWould I pay the hefty price and go through the agonizing wait? \n\nHell freaking yes.", "Really upsetting we were inline for lunch and there was so manny people there they were not able to seat us for two hours and when we finally got up there they were going to charge us an overwhelming amount for dinner not lunch. We were there in plenty of time for lunch but they did not want to honor it. We walked so far to get there only to be turned away waiting in line for two hours. They did not care. They did not need our money. If you go enjoy the Waite because that may be all you get.", "Massively disappointing. Except for the seafood section. Everything else was bland, dry, under seasoned and overcooked. Not worth $65 under any circumstances.", "How do you turn a 5 star place into 2 stars?  You get GREEDY!  I was here yesterday and they raised the price to $55 per dinner.  That's pretty expensive.\n\nService was very spotty and it looks like they downgraded the quality of the items in their buffet.  The Chinese spareribs are gone and so are many of my favorite items.  Just plain SAD SAD SAD.\n\nFirst, they added a lot of salt to every entree.  Second, they increased the volume of the music in the buffet.  Finally, they jacked up the price and lowered the service level.\n\nI get the point.  Now the buffet order has been restored on the strip.  Bellagio and Wynn are back on top.\n\nWhat moron would blare music during dinner?  Is that a tactic to drive you out sooner?\n\nThe marinade on the ribs tasted horrible and was full of salt.  Crab legs were not that fresh but it didn't stop them from serving it.  The balsamic strawberry gelato is just plain wrong and disgusting.\n\nWaited a long time to get a refill on my drinks.  This should be automatic.", "Don't bother coming here unless u're a glutton for punishment. We got their fast passes, which told us to come back in three hours. We came back three hours later, and had to wait over an hour in line to pay! After paying there's another half hour wait to be seated. I don't understand their system?! If you tell your guests to come back at a specific time (6:57pm) why does it take another hour to pay, and another half hour to wait in line?", "Very poor choice \nVery poor quality of food\nNo single item was tasty enough to try more than once. \nFor the price it was a total rip off, AVOID. \nTotal waste of time, poor quality and poor choice \nThe decor and seating was no different to a cheap diner", "Total waste of time.  Checked in at the kiosk and told to return 2 hours laters.  No problem plenty to do in Vegas!  Returned at told time and told to wait in line and it would be another 2 hours of waiting in line.  With my bad back no way I was standing in line for 2 hours after checking in 2 hours prior!  Plenty of better restaurants to eat at then gorging your face at this buffet!", "I came here for the Christmas holiday dinner buffet with my husband and found it way too overpriced. The price for the holiday dinner buffet was much higher than the standard $50/person. \nFirst there was a 2-hour wait time for the dinner buffet, and because we didn't want to wait that long we paid an extra surcharge for the separate VIP-ish line that was much shorter. Our total came to about $200 with tax and tip. \nWhen we got into the buffet, we were overwhelmed with all the food, but to be honest much of the food tasted only average or mediocre. Maybe this was because the buffet was packed with so many people during the holiday season, but everything was just a waste of my money. Nothing really stood out, many of the dishes could be found elsewhere, the food stations were relatively dirty with scrap food lying around, and overall, it was too hectic in there. \nThe fresh seafood station was always empty because people took way too many at one time and the chicken and waffles...everyone took the chicken but not the waffles so there were lonely waffles laying around with no chicken.\nI'm not going back and I prefer Wicked Spoon!", "Awful experience. Will NEVER go back to Caesar's Palace. Got a ticket at a kiosk to come back 80 minutes later. They were supposed to text me but never did. Came back after 80 minutes and their employee said it would be 30-45 min in line. We waited in line for two hours. When we were closer to the front they said it would be another hour.  We then left and went to a normal restaurant. We've eaten here several times before. It is not worth waiting in line for. We will never be back to eat or gamble. It is not an upscale casino.", "Snobby checkin desk. Wouldnt answer a question. Seemed to hate their life, decided to leave instead", "What a disappointment!\nThe positive Yelp reviews, long lines, and pricey entrance fee make me wonder what I'm missing?\nThe only items worth visiting a second time would be the King crab legs and some of their desserts.  \nThe crab legs were cut in half, which in my opinion ruins it completely, and served either frozen or boiled.  The boiled option made the crab meat so watered down and flavorless.  \n \nThe meat section just consisted of cheap brisket and sausages.  Although the guy cutting up the meat was hilarious.  The rest of the food doesn't even deserve to be mentioned.  Fortunately, the line and wait wasn't that long so we were able to get in and get out.  \n\nThis was probably the first time leaving a buffet without a food coma.\nEnded up having to get something else after :(", "Every time I go to Vegas I have to eat here because I love the food! But after what happen tonight they will never get my business any more! We are a family of 6, I have 4 kids 8,6,4 and a 7 months old. We got here at 7:30 checked in on the kiosk and was given a wait time of about 2hrs. We decided to go to the food court to feed the kids since they were hungry and wasn't going to wait that long to eat. At 8:06pm I was texted to come back, upon coming back I waited about 40mins more standing in line to pay. Getting to the cashier I told her how many I had in my party, but I was only going to pay for 2 adults because my kids ate already and she said that's fine but if they do eat they'd have to pay and I said of course I was fine with that, she then told me to proceed and let the hostess know the situation. I'm not one to skimp on paying meals for my kids. I told the hostess and she said I'm not sure if we can do that, she then called and asked her manager, and the manager said no and that I'd have to pay for the kids. So I told the hostess to call the manager back, I spoke to the manager and her reasoning was because we'd be taking up seats for 7 ppl, which I only had 6, and there's still people that has a 2hr wait and there might be a party that will be paying for 5 seats. My husband told her, so if it was my wife and I and we had quadruplette babies we'd still be taking up a space for 6 and only paying for 2. She then got flustered and couldn't answer us and started going around in circles. She also went on to tell us that the cashier didn't tell me it was ok, so I confronted the cashier with the manager there and the cashier said yes I told her it would be ok to pay for the adults and the kids can come in. The manger not only doesn't know how to count but she's a liar too! The manager's name is Rebecca by the way!\nThis is not the first time that this buffet has been not accommodating to families with kids. I've given them a second chance since they remodeled. Before it was bacchanal we came here and my son was just not having a good day and he was crying and the manager had the nerve to ask us to leave after we paid and were seated! \nThis was the last straw for me. I love the food here, but because of  the horrible customer service today I will never be going back! Sometimes good food, but bad service makes a restaurant horrible!", "My cousin and aunt came in from NYC last Saturday.  We had been planning the trip for six months and had prepaid for helicopter rides, show tickets, the whole nine yards.  I recommended Caesar's Buffet because I have heard so many good things about it.  It is been the worst experience of the week!  We were gravely disappointed!  I had been told there were lobster tails there, but upon arrival I saw a sign in the case that said $62 for a whole lobster - nothing about a lobster tail.  We had to wait AN HOUR AND A HALF for shrimp!!!!  We kept going up and the man said they were waiting for it to come from the warehouse!  Did they not know they were serving dinner that day????  Several of the dishes looked like they had been left over from lunch - and some were not very tasty.  There were a few items we liked, but were very dissatisfied over the lobster and shrimp.  By the time the shrimp arrived we were ready to leave.  That was ridiculous.  But what was even more ridiculous was the fact that we had such difficulty getting someone to give us a drink and refill ...that my cousin had to actually get up and get the pitcher to refill our own iced tea!!!!!!!  I have never been so embarrassed in my life to have recommended a pricey buffet and have all of this happen!", "At 55 dollars a plate and with an hour wait to then wait in line for 30 minutes, it's a little intimidating. But worth it. Buffett is full of gourmet foods that are all you can eat. Considering how overpriced the strip is with food, this place is actually somewhat economical when you take into account its quality. We ended up eating there both nights in Vegas, it's an experience.", "Food was ok but got food poisoning and ruined my trip. I would be very weary of the seafood.", "The response from the assistant general manager was unacceptable!  She said she was \"sorry\" for the poor experience and that she would give me 20% off BREAKFAST or LUNCH in the future.  I did not go there for breakfast or lunch.  How could that possibly make up for a horrible dinner?  They can take their 20% and pay it to the servers who never refill your drinks!  I choose to go elsewhere! Oh ... and when you call and ask about the lobster tails...apparently they are only on the weekends and they raise the price even higher for that....they have MULTIPLE prices for times of day and days of the week so it seems you never know what you are going to get because the lady on the phone said \"sometimes\" we have lobster tails....hmm.  I was just laughing to myself as I was looking to see that most of the GREAT reviews for Bacchanal were from the year 2012.  There you have it.", "I was very disappointed.

One in which you get a time estimate and are expected to go back to the buffet when you are called. The 2nd wait is to pay and this is most frustrating part. 90% of the people who are filtered through to pay are folks that paid $25 to skip the line.

After a drunken stupor night of clubbing and when you get told that you danced with a troll or troglodyte, this is your sanctuary. I am assuming the name Bacchanal is a tribute to Bacchus, the Roman name for Dionysus, the god of wine and intoxication. So by deduction, I think the place means you need to drunk off of food.\n\n--WHAT SHOULD I ORDER--\n\n1) With literally every type of patron, there is something for you. For example, the first part of the place hosts a seafood delicacy. It has crab legs, shrimp, salmon etc.\n\n2) Its got a meat (beef, pork, chicken, turkey) carving station to satisfy that man meat you been missing out on if that's what you fancy.\n\n3) Its got Sushi, Chinese food, hell its even got a taco making station.\n\n4) The dessert bar is separate and it even has a whole island to itself.\n\n5) Wear comfy clothes.\n\n--HOW IS THE SERVICE--\n\nIts Vegas, so you get top service at this buffet.

High expectations often puts you at risk for more disappointment than necessary... Ok enough of Ms. Obvious. The chicken n waffles photos I saw online before we went, we're NOT there anymore, at least not the same version when we went... Instead we got a waffle cone (yes, like an ice cream cone) with waffle fries and one tiny chicken wing.  The wing was synonymous to grocery deli status and the fries were like high school cafeteria.  The waffle cone itself tasted like a fortune cookie gone wrong.  \n\nThe dim sum was OK except the egg roll tasted like fried wrapper surrounding soft doughy wrapper inside... Albeit a few pieces of previously frozen veggies.  The wide Asian noodles tasted like they had sat out for a while... Ok, so we went around 8pm, but if they're going to lower the quality then they best lower the price.  Full price expects full service and quality.  Not even including tip, we paid roughly $60pp.  The noodles were worse than if Sizzler decided to make Asian noodles at 6am in preparation for dinner that night.\n\nThe dessert was just eh... Everything was attractive... Not Bellagio attractive, but appetizing looking enough... Flavor was NOT there either. How do you have molten chocolate cake with zero goo in the middle?

It's true, this is the biggest buffet place you will ever see. Let's start with drinks: I ordered OJ and it was not fresh squeezed. The coffee was pretty good, on the other hand. Without giving out the long and boring details, you can skip the Chinese section, the Italian was not bad, and the seafood section was okay as long as plates weren't under the heat lamp too long. The carving station was good but nothing too special. We didn't try Mexican. The dessert selections were hit and miss.

Maybe it was techno night when we dined. 10/18/15.\n\nSome food are not fresh and have been kept under the lamp too long. The Stone Crab legs were so hard to open, it is not worth the laundry afterwards. Minimal Sushi selection. Salty Meats. Service was so so and the music was way too loud for a restaurant.", "This was close to 5 stars but unfortunately I was let down by the cleaning the staff. The food was the best I had in Vegas without a doubt and worth every penny! My personal favorite station was the dessert station... Tons of amazing and tasty treats that kept me coming back after I was stuffed! This buffet was so chic as well but towards the end I was terribly grossed out. My boyfriend and I went up to try more food and came back to find tons of dirty, slobbered on dishes on our table! My guess is the waiter thought we were done and decided to clean all around our table and place all of everyone's dirty dishes on our table! It was so gross to sit down and look at the mess placed where my purse and food was sitting! I mean i can understand confusion but that should never happen! It really put a stop to our appetite.. It's a shame because the taste of the food was spectacular", "My experience actually happened around May 2015. Horrible attitude from the hostess. Basically, she ruined our family  dinner. She started to give us attitude  from the beginning.... long story short, we were a party of 8, but we decided to divide our group into two, and the hostess, purposely, sat one to the north pole and the other to the south pole even though  there were plenty  of tables right beside of each end. Called the manager  and he apologized but nothing much happened. Hope that hostess (white-hispanic  looking, chubby one w black long hair) gets fired. Do u think I am harsh? Nah...ppl w those attitude should  not be in the service  industry. Will not come back to this buffet  ever.", "Lots of food and mediocre flavor. All the dishes are displayed beautifully but once you take a bite, it's anti-climatic.\nAlot of the staff were frowning too, in particular, our waitress.

So much potential just by the looks but again, no flavor.", "And this trumps wicked spoon.\nNoticeably the most expensive buffet on the strip ... At $41 for lunch.  \nBut it's quality...

Pistachio gelato was missing key pistachio ingredients.\nCrime br\u00fbl\u00e9e made in aluminum throw away tins without a crunchy top sugar.\n\nNo one took the fries with all this good food so it is no longer crisp but soggy and chewy.", "My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place and we thought, by the line, this place was going to be fantastic. Well, it wasn't. You have to go to a kiosk to put your name in, the wait time for almost 3 hours. But wait, if you pay $25 per person, you can be a VIP and not have to wait so we decided to do that. It costs $168 for a BUFFET! I get it, we are in Vegas, everything is pricey but come on!!!! Ok, so the food, there was a boat load of it but overall, it wasn't that great, wasn't horrible either. The deserts looked great but they didn't taste very well at all. A lot of wasted food. Would I recommend this place? Absolutely not!", "This my 4th time eating here and this will be my last.  At $54 per person, it's over priced period. \n\nEach trip has seen the food quality, quality control drop drastically and cutting corners with cheaper ingredients such as noodles for their soup.   No longer fresh udon but the cheap noodles that beak apart and lack flavor and texture. \n\nCrab legs - cut and boiled and now too salty and mushy.  Used to be served whole.  Cut crab legs are messy to eat and lose flavor.   \n\nDuck - slimy and oily. \n\nSalmon - no flavor\n\nOysters - yuck.  Too big and too slimy.   No longer fresh, these are frozen and low quality.    \n\nHere is the problem, The buffet when it was new, was able to turn the food easier because all the menu items were still novelty to new customers.   Now that the buffet has been around for years, customers are repeat and the novelty has worn off.   Return customers know what they want to eat and those are mostly the \"staple\" buffet items like crab legs.   They no longer eat the novelty menu items and the result is they sit and get old and no longer fresh.   They have too many items to prepare that the result is none of them are that good anymore.   They need to reel it in, cut items that no one eats (meal acceptability can determine that) and make the staple items outstanding.   \n\nIt's really too bad because this used to be the best buffet around.  Now it's just a subpar quality buffet with way too many choices.  Over half the items I ate were too salty and even my coffee was not good.  \n\nYes you can find enough items to make a meal but you be left feeling unsatisfied knowing what you paid for the experience.  \n\nFood - 5/10\nPrice - 3/10\nAmbience - 8-10\nDesserts - 2-10  if it looks pretty, don't eat it \nI cannot recommend this buffet.", "Base on 4 stars here. We decided try on dinner buffet here.i put very high expectation for that. Cause this is the most expensive dinner buffet compare a lot other 5 stars hotels. Totally disappointment! Tiny skinny over salty king carb legs, overcooked mussels, only limited selection of sushi and no sashimi?! Wth?! Desserts are total let down! Tiny unfresh strawberry coated with chocolate is nothing compare the neighbor hotel. Seriously $114 for 2 I can have a really good 3 course dinner else where.", "We were so excited to try this buffet after reading all the reviews on Yelp.  I think when it opened the quality of it must have been better.\n\nWe arrived at 2 p.m. on a Saturday. Because the wait was 2 hours, we decided to spring for the additional $25 per person to go through the Express Lane.  We still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table.  Once we were seated, hubby and I went through the buffet line to see if anything caught our eye.  Nothing really stood out besides the juice bar so we started with the seafood.  The seafood starts with some hot entrees such as fish, lobster ravioli, paella, clams and then moves into cold items cerviche, oyster shooters, and thai noodle salad and finally the stone crab claws, shrimp, and king crab legs.  For how much we paid, you would think they would be constantly replenishing not only the food but also the condiments.  Not true.  There was no clarified butter or cocktail sauce when we got to these items.  Didn't like that the crab legs were cold, but if you go to the Italian food section, they have hot crab legs there, which is what I did.  Hubby enjoyed the street tacos but there weren't many other offerings in the Mexican food station.  Tried the old standards of prime rib, mashed potatoes.  Wanted some brisket but they had run out.  Honestly, don't know how you can mess up prime rib and mashed potatoes but the prime rib was tough and the mashed potatoes were pasty, almost as if they were boxed.  Very disappointing.  \n\nWanted to try something from the Italian food station, but all they had out were two types of pasta, meatballs, and one pizza.  Really, the pizza area had four empty platters, every time I came back, there was only one pizza out and the cold cuts area was always empty.  Tried the cold cuts twice and each time they hadn't replenished the food.  The worst food was the Chinese food station.  Tried the dim sum - they have the usual shiu mai, har gow, and soup dumplings.  The wrappers on all of these were so thick, not worth even eating.  The spicy stir fried eggplant was not cooked through and the black bean crab had been sitting around for a while.  The peking duck was very greasy.\n\nThought they could redeem themselves with the desserts so I decided to try a little of everything, unfortunately met the same problem, very little selection as they hadn't restocked.  I tried the oreo cookie mousse (pretty good), blood orange cream puff (don't try it), flan (nah), cr\u00e8me brulee (best out of everything), molten lava cake (very dry and not molten), cheesecake (skip it), and various gelatos (that was yummy).\n\nOverall, the hype was not justified.  Based on the food we had and their inability to even keep the stations stocked, we won't be returning.  It was just a big, overpriced, disappointment.", "We went here tonight on our last night in Vegas to celebrate our anniversary and for $112 I was absolutely pissed off at the food quality.  What we ate and what they had to offer was really quite disgusting.  The Asian food was gross. The salad bar was lackluster. The crab legs are tasteless and the butter machine wasn't even turned on so the butter was cold.  The Mexican food looked nasty and I tried some nachos and they were way too spicy.  The American food all tastes like burning wood and the mashed potatoes were lumps of nasty tastes! And afterwards well lets just say.....I stayed close to a bathroom the rest of the night.... Mild case of food poisoning!!!!", "i'd rather go to m - aria and wicked spoon in cosmo - almost same food they offer but the price is ridiculous", "I've waited years to go here and sadly was very let down. Wagu sliders were charred and the buns were dry and crispy, the low mien noodles were cold, green bean almandine was under seasoned. My wife actually was spitting out things. \nSuper sad. Also, for those with but allergies, there is almost nothing safe to eat at the dessert buffet.", "Four of us went there on a Thursday for brunch. We got the VIP which included mimosas. This place is not cheap so I expected the to be wowwed. We weren't. There was a great selection. Loved that they served pho but all our food was room temp!  I'm not sure if they had their ac on but nothing we selected was hot. The steak and eggs was cold, the chilaquiles were cold! Couldn't eat most of it. Good thing they had a great dessert selection. This place was not worth the almost $150 we spent. Will not be coming back.", "I hardly want to put review as matter affect this probably the first 1. This was our favorite buffet place as been here many times but this time 3 of 4 of us got food poisoning. Only 1 of kid didn't as he only eat salami and rice. Really bad experience as spending over $150 and suffer for this.\nManagement, you have to focus more on your food quality.", "I brought my family here on a Tuesday, which was yesterday. My mother, my daughter, and I came here around 11:20 am, and saw the automated  check-in stations (machines) right in front of the line, and several people were already using them. Without a doubt we went up to the the machine on the left, and started checking us in. The results showed we had to wait for 49 minutes, and we'd get a text message when we had to come back. Behind those check in machines there was already a line going. At the entrance to that line was the hostess. I thought my 49 minute wait is the estimation to how long I'd be waiting in line, so I went up to the hostess to ask. She (I think her name was Emma) said that I had to wait 49 minutes before I could get in line, so the three of us got in the corner there and waited to be called. Less than in a minute I saw two families come up to the check in machines. The hostess rushed to those families before they could even start checking in, and told them to get in line. I came up to her, and said that it was not fair and not nice of her to treat us differently, to what she got very aggressive, and started explaining to me about some yellow lines in her computer, that the people whom she texted did not show up, and that she had to make sure the line was filled with people up to a certain area. Things she said were irrelevant. She saw us standing there, and when we went up to her the line was not full. I left with a feeling that their check in system is not effective, or the staff doesn't follow it well, or she had something against me, or the hostess lets people, who tip her get further in line.", "Never done this in my life ever. You have to literally pay and wait in line for more than three hours to get seated. I mean why would anyone pay to suffer this long wait. Don't come here ever, it's just a normal buffet.", "Never made it in so the review is for their incompetence with organizing the lines on thanksgiving day.  I expected for it to be long and wouldn't have mind leaving because of this.  But the lines, if you want to even call it that, was just one big giant crowd of mess that didn't move anywhere.

I was only second in line during this entire process.\n\nThen somebody came around at about 3:40pm to say they weren't accepting express lane tickets.  People started complaining (obviously -- we'd been standing in line for close to an hour at this point) so they allowed us to remain in the express lane (that didn't move).\n\nFor another half an hour the \"EXPRESS\" line didn't move as the regular line moved past.\n\nAt 4:25pm they took my money ($118 -- they still charged me an express fee) and sent me to another line.  \n\nAround 4:40pm I still stand in line waiting to be seated after spending $118 on lunch.  \n\nHey, Caesar!

The problem is that while fast pass is a well executed system the Bacchinal at Caesars is a disaster.  100's of people with passes to stand in line after 8pm are turned away because he second wait is so long that the buffet will close before you get to the front.  There is no management system that says \"hey, too many people have requested an 8pm time, let's close ticketing.\"  This results in hours of wasted time and probably lots of people throwing away money at the slots while they wait.

Only the omelettes and toasts got taken out and replaced with sliders.\n\nFoods of what I can recall:\n\nSEAFOOD section: Jonah crab claws, roasted mussels, shrimp, mini shrimp cups (no oysters or crab legs *sadface*)\n*crab claws and shrimp was the standout!\n\nCOMFORT FOOD section: mac n cheese, bread, bacon, omelettes, sliders, fries and fried chicken\n*Bacon wass awesomeeeee!

There is no wait", "Been a few years since they first opened and wow, how have things changed for the worse, service-wise. Based on the shockingly chaotic system now, you've been warned: avoid this buffet (at least during the holidays). PR disaster here with many visibly frustrated people in the crowds around the buffet, but what does the buffet care? They will ring in the money anyway, despite lots of unhappy people and negative word going around. That's an unfortunate vibe that came off to me.\n\nIt's man versus machine. When you walk up to the buffet, there are now rows of ticket machines. No notable sign explaining what these machines are (they're like the Fast Pass machines at Disneyland). You're expected to wade through the crowds and insert your information into the machine and the screen tells you when exactly to come back -- do not expect anything less than three hours! Many of these machines don't even work, so even though you're supposed to get a ticket, they end up telling you that you \"don't need a ticket.\" The system is *supposed to* help spread out/manage the crowds, and it's *supposed to* be your \"ticket\" in at the allotted time.\n\nBut when we come back at the time we were scheduled for and found a worker, he told us that they're not letting any more people in to the buffet even with a \"ticket\" and that the wait will be another 3 hours (so, a total of 6 hours). There are just \"too many people we didn't expect.\" Wait. So what was the point of scheduling and giving out tickets and waiting the three hours? And why not alert people of the extreme wait times BEFORE they wait the three hours only to be then turned away. After all, the machine took contact information. Why bother with a flawed system that ultimately is much more confusing and chaotic than simply lining up when you get there? Unlike Disneyland's FastPass, this ticket system is a disorganized mess.\n\nFinally, if you try to clarify with any of the few workers here, they respond with curt, smug replies. Maybe it's the holiday stress on everyone, but their demeanor and really lack of service or care is unfortunate and not helping the situation. No answers for anyone.\n\nFamily and I were looking forward for another go here, but it looks like we won't ever be trying again.", "Really good but the wait is terrible.  We were in a shorter line because we are platinum members but the wait was still LONG.  We came for Christmas eve dinner so I know that it is a holiday but from what I hear the wait is long regardless of a holiday or not.  For the price you get a very big selection of delicious food.  I was sad to see that there was no lobster because they had lobsters on display in the front.  Other than those two things I have no complaints.", "I've been in line for 2 hours, there is still about an hour to go, worst experience of my entire life.

But we knew we would have to wait a while and were fine with that. We've waited for tables in the past for 1.5 hours so we are used to it. \n\nWe checked into the electronic kiosks and were given a wait time of 60-75 mins. We thought that was reasonable as we could wait in a bar and they would text us when we had to return. BOY WERE WE WRONG. We were texted about 15 minutes later to report to the hostess. We returned to the restaurant only to find that we had to stand in a line that lasted TWO hours. We then got up to the hostess who told us we had about another 20 minute wait to be seated. We already committed so much time to this endeavor that we agreed and paid. We then proceeded to wait in said line for over an hour.  So after almost 3.5 hours we were finally able to eat.\n\nAfter all that, the food is pretty good but not amazing. There's a huge selection of foods and an extraordinary variety. There's no denying that this buffet is great. However, In my opinion, no food is worth standing in line for 3.5 hours. We were mostly angry at the disparity in advertised wait time with actual wait time. ( and the wait would have been probably twice as long but half the people in front of us gave up on the wait and left for other restaurants.)\n\nIf you want to try this place out, do so at your own risk and don't plan anything else for later in the night because you will probably be waiting for longer than you think......", "I was here multiple times today and I have to say it gets worse every time I go. To me it was the best buffet in Vegas when it started. Now the wait for much longer the service got worse prices got higher and worst of all the food quality got worse as well. I missed many good dishes today. Most of the meat was dry, strawberries were old and not fresh. The decorations were so dusty and looked tired. \nI hope they improve but at this time I cannot recommend the buffet anymore. It is still a good buffet but not for $54 plus tax and tip. The tuna sushi did not look really fresh and the worst were the oysters. They looked dry and tasted very fishy. Oysters are not supposed to be like that. It's two stars because they somehow managed to keep the cues inside the buffet short. This really was an issue a while ago. Also the dessert buffet was really excellent apart from the old old strawberries. Our waiter kept on bringing me Mountain Dew although I ordered green tea. Then at some point he did not come by again. I think they stop serving you after 60 min in the meal which is really unfair considering that we waited 90 minutes to get a seat. I would rather go to wicked spoon I think. It's not better per se but prices are lower and there is hardly any wait.", "so many options where it made difficult to experience all dishes in one visit not once did I have a bad experience food service and everything was excellent.", "For $59 branch, I'd expect better food and service from it. It has the slimmest crab legs I have seen from any buffet, I do meant any. The table was rarely cleaned nor the glasses refilled even once. The rest of the food is ok, and was the exactly the same from two years ago. Oh, the newly installed system to check in to avoid the line? It was another line you have to stand behind to get your phone number entered. Once you entered your information, you get a text msg for you to come back.... So you could wait in line for 40 minutes. I have no idea what's the point of that except now they have my phone number. \n\nMy next door table have to complain to the manager for lack of service and they get some comp. I didn't feel like to added more to it except here on Yelp. \n\nI think this will be my last time here. Bye bye Caesar!", "I am writing this review to inform everyone that if you are thinking about having your special event at the Bacchanal Buffet do not do it. After signing a contract and believing I had the best experience of my life I was slammed 10 days later with an unknown $3,000 charge. When I tried calling the Bacchanal it took them days to get back to me. They first claimed that I had a table outside of our groups private room that resulted in me having over 10 more people than I actually had and that's what the charge was for. When I asked who made the head count they admitted there was no head count taken but they counted the number of chairs that were in the room... last I checked chairs were inanimate objects that didn't eat food so I don't know why they would base my head count off of chairs and not actual people. They never sent me any kind of invoice when the charge occurred, then when I finally got a hold of someone over the phone that was actually part of Bacchanal management I was told that they were willing to give me a \"discount\" of 3 people for the mysterious 10 people that they wrongfully charged me for. I of course did not accept. The last I heard they would be having a meeting about it and get back to me within 1-4 days. That was over 2 months ago. Very disappointed with the unprofessional behavior I experienced from upper management. I even requested that video camera footage be pulled of my group walking back so a head count could be performed by their management... conveniently they delete all of their video footage every 7 days.", "I would have given 4 stars for the food. The reason why I'm giving 2 is due to the lack of enforcement on checking to make sure people aren't cutting. (Why bother with setting up machines and issuing tickets when you guys don't even care if people are cutting the lines??)\n\nWent on Christmas Day, I don't have a problem with waiting as that's expected on a holiday as such. It was busy and waits were long, that's fine. What I do have a problem with are the mainland Chinese people cutting in line and telling other Chinese people that it's ok to cut. I'm watching these people get tickets and then going straight in line when our family got our ticket around 10am for a return early afternoon. \n\nBTW, I'm Chinese myself and I have no effin tolerance for this type of bs and I'll call your ass right out!! (Sick and tired of these Chinese people coming here from abroad thinking they can bring their bad habits and not follow rules). Which me and my husband did to these ladies right behind us that somehow crossed over to the other side and paid before our eyes. Are you serious? Earlier on, there was a lady that was checking tickets before people got in, she specifically told them that they cannot get in line yet because they just got their tickets and needed to come back at a later time. Well, they still continued to wait in line and didn't get kicked out which i don't understand. (the check point lady saw them still waiting). \n\nWhen we got to the paying area, we told the employees and they looked confused and had no idea how it happened and just tried to bs their way out of trouble. I should have called on a manager, but I decided to let it go, at this point, we were all tired and hungry and just wanted to get seated and have a nice meal. \n\nIf the bacchanal management team is reading this, you guys should really try to employ people who are competent at doing their job and checking to make sure people aren't cutting. When one person does this, it ruins it for many of us. I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate it if you were in my shoes.", "I never knew there was an entire room with more buffet stations until my 3rd visit!  I guess they stick the more asian fare back there.  This place is too trendy right now so the wait is too long and $50 for weekend lunch was not worth it.  They didn't even have any oysters or lamb!  Prime rib was dry and overcooked.  There was nothing of value in this meal.", "Ok. The food is good but not significantly better than other buffets in town. The wait is RIDICULOUS. There are three waiting periods. The first is dictated by the sign-in kiosk. 230 min (yes, that's almost 4 hours). The second wait is at the registration line. 1:40h. The third wait is on the \"wait to be seated line\". 45 min. Did you do the math? 6 hours and 15 min. Staff is unpleasant about it all and the thousands of fellow attendees are mainly very large groups of entitled gamblers and their spoiled children. Stay away!", "To get the most bang for your buck here, load up on the meats and seafood since those seemed to be the highest quality. And make sure not to eat too much carbs because you'll want to eat dessert too (they have custom crepes *heart eyes) \n\nThey have every food you could possibly think of: sushi, chinese, soup, breads, various salads, mexican, american, italian and the list goes on and on. There's things to eat for everyone definitely. \n\nI didn't love it because the wait was long (expected in Vegas but still not fun) and I'm not a huge seafood person, also a lot of the other foods didn't really blow me away. Plus my friend's crab legs were still partially frozen which irked us :/ And the weekend buffet for dinner is most expensive at $56", "Terrible food, dry, flavorless, way over priced.  Oysters are nasty and seafood is sketchy.", "Looked up the best buffets in Vegas, chose to try them out and it was a big disappointment.  We arrived early for breakfast at 8:30, the wait was ridiculous, even considering that there was no one inside.  Once inside the food looked dry and a day old and the selection was a big let down.  We asked for the manager and chose to get our money back and try the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan; which was a better choice.", "I rarely give a place 2 stars.\n\nI'm not sure if I just came on a wrong day but this place definitely not worth the $60+ per person for dinner. Just go to wicked spoon which is almost half the price and 3 times better.\n\nThe sushi was just a mountain of rice with the thinnest slice of sashimi. So thin I didn't even think it was possible to cut a piece of sashimi so thin. Also the crab legs just tastes like I was eating sour seat salt. Everything else was just so so.", "Okay so Every time I come to vegas I end up eating here. It's been a hit or miss on depending the time and day of the week it is. Food tend to be more fresh at toward the end of the week. But I can say that I went to many places for the buffet there is really no place that can touch this.  You pay more here but the quality and variety of food is unmatched. Get there earlier to avoid long lines.", "I used to like this place but their kiosk system caused more trouble and is no longer worth the $55 dinner. Kids over 8 is $55 as well. Lunch is $50. The food is comparable to M studio but with the added headache.You get  there and will need to get a ticket, which tells you to come back 3 4 hours later only to wait in line for another hour to get in. I don't mind paying the price but the hassle is not worth the wasted time and hassle. Try it once if you can. Of course, we got the tickets but did not return, which probably happens often. Line was not long at all but the hostess has to follow their poor system.", "Not impressed! Food wasn't bad but it isn't as good as people say it is & the service needs improvement, all in all it wasn't worth the money nor the wait.  \n\nWaiting in the long line is so awful due in part to the lack of courtesy of those waiting in front or behind you. We had the worst people around us, really loud big group in front of us & group behind us constantly getting in our personal space either bumping us or breathing too closely. VERY uncomfortable!  Their msgText app seems like a good idea but be prepared to still wait a Looong time after you come back! \n\nThe food: cold mac & cheese, dry fried chicken, cuts of meat weren't good (too fatty or not seasoned well). Sushi wasn't too bad, crab legs were decent and the dumplings were very good. Dessert was great taste wise, but the lady at the crepe station wasn't friendly & gave me an attitude because I ordered two crepes (one for hubby & one for me). Every worker at the dessert section (except gelato area) seemed extremely stressed & unhappy...they were also out of plates! \n\nOur server messed up our drink order, no big deal; it happens, but then he wouldn't come back to refill our drinks. He kept us dry :( NEVER COMING BACK. Left feeling full & dirty but not satisfied.", "Horrible checking in system - the worst. \n\nWaited for almost an hour & the lady in front told us our name is not even on list. \n\nThat's just the wait time to stay in another line to pay..\n\nThe lady at the front was rude & disrespectful.. As if she's doing us a favor to talk to us ..\n\nLeft hungry & totally upset \n\nWill never go back .. \n\nNot going to pay top $$$ to be treated with disrespect", "Simply disgusting. We went there yesterday night at 6:30PM and the line wasn't too bad,30 mins.\n\nWe paid 170 (included tax, open bar and tip) for 2 people. The service wasn't bad but really fast and impersonal.\n\nThe food was the major disappointment: bad quality and all cold, the only decent thing were the dessert.\n\nJust a place for turist with that money you can go eat everywhere else on the strips with a better quality.", "Nothing special...way too expensive for the price. Don't expect any good quality sushi - no sashimi or good rolls. Besides the great selection of deserts everything else was disappointed. Wynn, Rio and Planet Hollywood's buffet was so much better.", "The service is poor, the hotel is dated, the staff is going through the motions, the restaurants serve cafeteria food. AVOID this hotel at all costs. Stay downtown before this resurrected dump.", "For a buffet you cannot do any better anywhere. Done deal", "This buffet used to be my #1 in Vegas, I come here every single time when I'm in town.  It just gone downhill so much to a point that it doesn't even worth $20 anymore. \n\nI went there again on Feb 23 based on my previous good experiences on their food selections (I have never had good experiences with their servers though), but this time it's the worst.\n\n1. I don't know if they have a problem with Asian.  They love to group all the Asians in a single corner and give them a lousy server.  My server, once again, had NEVER cleaned up the plates on time, every time when I came back with my food, I needed to push the dirty plates away from the table.  ALso during my dining 1 hour I had to find someone else, to call for my server to refill drinks TWICE.\n\n2. Food is horrible.  I mean, as you can see in the picture, this is what they called \"prime rib\".  I was so shocked and couldn't believe my eyes for a dinner costing $53 you're giving me such bad quality of food.  I then asked the butcher \"may I have a piece that is more red?\" he said \"No!  Next!\" and turned his head away.  I was really really shocked.\n\n3. The crowd of the restaurant had gone downhill too, the gentleman next to me took off his shoes and put his feet on the chair.  When I first asked my server if I could change my seat she said \"1 person 1 table, you already have 1 table\".  I ended up speaking to the ladies at the front to solve the problem.\n\nI'm so sorry, I will NEVER come back again.", "I always liked this buffet but today it was way below par. Really dropped off in quality and choices. Big disappoint.", "I was not impressed with food.The dim sum was good,and the dessert were ok.The meat selections weren't seasoned properly, I was disappointed with this place. I don't think this was worth the $90 we spent.", "Very disappointed with this buffet... How can u charge $55+tax, yet let the same pieces of food sit on the counter for the entire 2 hours??? Beyond unacceptable when ur \"sushi\" is crusted and hardened... That's straight disgusting and inedible... Oysters sat out for the whole 2 hours, crab legs were frozen to the point where ice was present in the crab legs... One of the most expensive buffets and not worth an 1/8 of what u charge... Even if I came at an off hour, that doesn't give u the right to serve me leftovers at the rate I paid... I waited patiently for them to change some of the food and that never happened... Never coming here again...", "An expensive buffet with sub par food and service.\n\nWe went to this buffet with an expectation of excellence, but only to encounter a rude greeter, a forgetful waitress, salty food, limited choice, and an environment equivalent to a $20 buffet.\n\nFor $42/person for lunch, we expected a lot more, especially when Wynn is charging under $30.\n\nWe are every disappointed and will not visit again.", "When I read other reviews, I wondered if I went to the same Bacchanal Buffet as the others did, because the experience I had was almost totally different. \n\nAt least, we agreed on one thing, it cost $56 plus tax. With this price, I think we should lift the bar a little bit higher if we are honest. However, I soon determined that you actually don't need high standard to classify Bacchanal Buffet to be poor. My first question was \"Where are the hundreds of selections as said by some reviews?\" Their selection is actually quite limited, at least much less than the buffet at M Casino or Rio Casino in Las Vegas.\n\nIf seafood is considered to be superb at Bacchanal, then where is lobster? And where is sashimi? You see none of these, but they dare to display several lobsters right at the front of the restaurant in a glass container to fool people. If they don't serve lobsters, this kind of act is evidently unethical, sort of misleading, misrepresented, and even cheating. \n\nThe night I went was on Saturday, March 12th, and I had tasteless prime rib, over salty beef rib, rock-hard lamb chop, warm-to-cold Asian watery rice (Congee), and clumsily chopped BBQ pork. Evidently, Bacchanal's food could  be claimed to be good only by those who seldom had quality or fine food and probably happened to be at Bacchanal to try an expensive food for the first time in their lives. If you're a bit more familiar with Las Vegas, you easily can find another buffet of much better quality with much less price at some other casinos of the same Caesars group in Las Vegas such as Planet Hollywood or Flamingo. \n\nIf you went to the same Bacchanal as I did, can you show me where their wide range of selected fruit is? Why could I only see some dull-white watermelon, sour-no-sweet pineapple, grainy cantaloupe, and nothing else? \n\nBy paying the pricy charge, I thought I should've been served with some finely prepared food there but honestly speaking, I didn't see any dishes that can be labeled as exquisite ones. Nevertheless, I did see arrays of pizza, taco,French fries, fried sweet potatoes, poorly layered mini-hamburger, simply stuffed mini-hotdog, heavily soy-sauced fried rice, over-oily fried noodles, and so on --- those common, cheap, mediocre and inauthentic items.      \n\nBesides being deeply disappointed by their food quality and food selection, I was also deeply amazed by the poor service rendered by their cashiers, ushers, some waiters and waitresses, some bus boys, and most of food servers behind the counters. They all looked so grumpy and most were arrogant to customers.", "Anything and everything you could ask for. It's pricy but you are getting what you pay for. I'll probably never go again--but it's a must if it's your first time in Vegas", "When I first got to this buffet I thought I died and went to heaven. That ended quickly when I decided to go to the meat station. The guy working there (Jake) was absolutely rude! I'm short (5'0) I get missed easily especially in big crowds. My husband and I were in line at the meat station, my husband got food and when it was my turned I got pushed back. I come around to the front and Jake actually refused to serve me saying I was cutting some imaginary line. What was worse, some random customers also got in on the fun by laughing at me with him about how I wasn't allowed to get food till I got in line when I was standing there for over 10 mins next to no one! He even went out of his way to ignore me and pretending like he couldn't see me even though I was directly in front of him. I was so embarrassed and felt so stupid that I started crying which made me feel like a fatty. I told a manager and all they could do was offer me food to fix the situation. Which was upsetting since I cared more about the treatment I received vs not getting food. I didn't take any food and left immediately after. I won't come here again.", "Service has gotten terrible. We had to wait over 10 minutes for a refill on our water. The table next to us waited almost 30 minutes for an organize juice. Buffet selection are numerous but poor service is no Bueno. If you have a party over 5 people be prepared to wait over 30 minutes for a table.", "This place was awful. My husband and I were sick about paying so much for less than mediocre. Corral has much better food and service. We get ripped off for paying the extra cost for all you can drink then found out it's on the 2 house wines which were disgusting. There's $40 down the drain. The prime rib sucked the crab wasn't fantastic. The best things one the whole buffet were the pizza and tacos which you could go somewhere else for. We are not picky people but our waiter was slow on bring long us our drinks and she was hateful. I get they were busy but into I should deal with the atmosphere of you going to work in such an environment. The desserts were not good either the gelato and fudge was the best and in my opinion it's pretty freaking he'd to screw up fudge: I would at least give the wicked spoon or another buffet a chance before ever doing here again. I don't understand how they are rated so high be aware you have a better chance of winning money in the casino then being please with this meal.", "I do not recommend this place! \nJust look at the floor!\nIt's so dirty!\n\nI lost my apetite when I saw that much dust yikes!!!!", "I've been to this buffet several times. It was my favorite LV buffet until this last time I went (which was in January 2016). \n\nEverything tasted old and just bad..! All the seafood was not fresh (to the point that I didn't even try the oysters -- didn't think it'd be safe). The crab legs were dry and the meat was completely tasteless. \n\nAfter a highly highly disappointing dining experience, my friends and I just decided to load up on dessert to make up for the nasty food. To our disappointment, even the dessert was bad...! My husband tried the mini churro, and he couldn't even bite it off because it was so old and tough... \n\nMaybe it was just an \"off\" day, but I'm not going to risk wasting almost $150 (for two people).", "Not worth the price of admission! The wait is terribly long! Over an hour just to pay $40 per person. There were no crab legs, lobster, or hot fish dishes. Minimal sushi choices and just about everything you could get at any other buffet for half the price! I will not be back here to eat mediocre food at an exquisite price tag!", "Five stars for food and negative four stars for the worst service. I used to work in customer service and offer lots of understanding, but the service here today was horrendous. I will not be coming back, which is a shame because the food selection and flavors were wonderful. None of the dishes were cleared off the table and everything was overflowing, and they didn't get us any refills or anything. The servers won't make eye contact so they don't have to serve you. I'm leaving $40 tip, but don't mistake that for good service. It was absolutely terrible. Do not come here if you want to be treated decently.", "Food was just average to me . 3 people for dinner close to $180. It really wasn't worth that $$$.\nOysters were dry, crabs were too salty, prime rib was kind of over cooked. Would not go again.", "The service wasn't great. The food was average. My son wanted spaghetti and was asked to choose between shell pasta and another one. There is a lot of variety of food to choose from but the taste was average.", "Worst service ever, estevan, took forever to come to our table, we had to look for him everywhere, seriously our empty plates were sitting on our table for 45 minutes, we had to ask someone else to pick them up, we paid for the unlimited alcohol drinks which is $18 per person, and he only showed up once in two hours, so guess what? I only had 2 beers because our server only showed up one time after bringing the first beer. I am so dissapointed, food is good but service is super bad, and when you get a bad service, it is more likely that you never go back to a place. I am a server and I know this is not a fine dining place but honestly, I was expecting much more from this buffet at the Caesars Palace Hotel in Las Vegas.", "I REALLY want to give this place more stars, but I just can't. We first came here two years ago when my husband and I got married. We had a fairly large group and our kids enjoyed it mostly because of the spectacular desert bar. I thought it was \"ok\". It's impressive to look at, but the food was just so-so; mainly because the hot items were barely lukewarm. I also wasn't impressed by the prime rib which was difficult to cut. I decided to give it another try this March and had the same experience, except two years ago there was quite a wait to get in, and this time there was no wait. Maybe it's because we were there for lunch both times? Still, at $40 a person, I expect food that hasn't been sitting out so long. I also don't care for the fact that the staff act like they really hate their jobs. Unfortunately, that's pretty typical in Vegas, though.  It's a fun place to go once, but after two times I think I've had my fill.  If this were a $20 meal I would give it three or four stars, but the food and service just isn't worth $40.", "Having dined here a couple of times, I think the long lines and the high pricing doesn't deserve The long Walt or cost. The cheaper snow crab legs are what is served here rather than Alaskan crab legs. Variety and dessert selections are OK, but I can go to Bellagio or the Wynn for similar buffet selections and avoid the longer lines.", "We made the mistake of coming here on Easter Monday (who knew this was a holiday?).  They charged us about $65 a person since it was a special occasion.  Anyway - we were too far in to turn back at that point so we went for it (standing in line for too long/not eating for 18 hours etc).  They did not have any king crab as I have seen many people mention in their reviews, but they did in fact have a large variety of food.  Unfortunately, for the price I don't think that the experience was worth it.", "They had a lot of options but the food wasn't all that great it was edible but I think it just attracted people with the presentation. Hype", "Be careful of the oysters,  I got a stomach flu (maybe Norovirus) after eating them 3 days ago, now still feeling sick.", "We came here for brunch on a Saturday.  We had a large party, about 12 total, so we had to sit in 2 different tables.  That was fine with us considering they were side by side.  This place is huge! You definitely have to do at least 1 walk through prior to you getting your food just to plan your attack.  \nThe seafood portion is what I spent my most time on.  I liked the crab legs that were in the hot water the most. Even though they were sliced open for us, they didn't give you enough meat per slice.  I would have preferred they just cracked it open but not slice it completely in half.  That was you get the full meat per leg section.  I also tried the bloody mary oyster shots.  I wouldn't recommend this at all.  Once you get past the bloody mary taste, it gets worse from there.  The crawfish had no flavor and the mussels were dry.\nThe sushi portion of this buffet is something you should skip.  It wasn't impressive at all and the flavors make you question the freshness of the fish.  \nThe Asian portion was also not impressive.  The dishes I tried were all bland and dry.  \nFor the amount of hype this buffet receives I expected better.", "Went around 4pm and did not have to wait long to be seated which was a plus. It is such a beautiful place. When you first walk in you see the desserts and crab legs. While I am not a fan of seafood, it did look good. The I fixed my first two plates, I didn't even know that there was a whole other section that wraps around. It seemed to go forever. The variety was good and the tastes were satisfying. We paid 125 for two adults and a child but it was good. They say you don't leave when you are full or miserable, you leave when you hate yourself. While I didn't hate myself, It was close to being miserable.", "Dined here on a Thursday around 3:00pm. We were seated promptly and had a server attend us shortly thereafter. The servers were amazing! One person in our group was vegan and the server went out of his way to grab her freshly made vegan entrees (she also had a wide selection at the buffet itself). \n\nThe food is bomb! There was a wide variety to choose from. I stuck to the prime rib, seafood, and asian stations (sushi & dim sum). The crab legs were not my favorite, but everything else made up for it.\n\n-1 star for one of the employees working behind the counter (a gentleman working behind the crab legs/oyster station with facial piercings/septum ring). He seemed to be in a foul mood and was extremely rude. No smile and when I asked a question he answered in the most condescending way. At another time I told my friend I would meet her at the table after I grabbed some tabasco. He rudely interjected without even looking at us and said \"You can get it from your server.\" I didn't know he was talking to us and asked \"Im sorry, what was that?\" to which he replied \"You can get tabasco from your server\", still at no point looking up from what he was doing (BTW there's tabasco bottles on the buffet line)\n\nOverall the food and servers are amazing. Without that one rude employee I would rate this buffet a 5/5.", "Wanted to charge me $200 for (2) 24hr passes. Food was ok but not at all worth $60/head.. I'll pass on the next visit.", "Hands down the best buffet on the strip. They have a wide variety of foods and desserts. Different types of meats: there's crab legs,  pizzas with toppings you don't normally see at other places, an Asian section, Italian section, and mexican section amongst a few others. The hostess and waiters are friendly and helpful.  It is on the expensive side but, in my opinion,  it's worth it.  The only downside is you could be waiting to get in for a while due to the long lines. Come hungry and leave happy. ..or guilty for eating so damn much.", "For the price it's not all that and I'm talking about the food and the staff, most of them including the cooks are rude not all of them but the majority are. Lots of pork on their food like bacon and the signing isn't to clear on it, seafood is the big reason why it's expensive (of course).\n \nBut here's the kicker they give you a 2 hour dining limit! Wtf I mean I didn't plan on it but fuck at $50 a pop don't put a limit on me. \n\nIt's Vegas guys amazing food at every Corner don't break your wallet for shit you can get back home for half price.", "This is without a doubt the best buffet I've been to.  The selection is huge and indulgent, which is definitely the whole point.  Of course, don't go here and expect the dim sum to be the best dim sum or the tacos to be the best tacos, but the overall vastness of the variety is second to none and the average quality of each item is definitely above average for buffet.  When you feel a need for excess eating this is the best place to go.  The wait is brutal, but you can pay extra to skip the first line, which is definitely worth it if you don't feel like playing video poker for a couple hours.", "Unfortunatly my experience in bacchanal wasnt what we expect at all for 50 dollars per person! the food wasnt good, especially the seafood the main reason we choose bacchanal. The oysters had rocks and in my opinion were unservable and the crab as really dry.even the meat on my strret tacos was burn like the staff didnt care about it, they spend more time talking to each other than taking care of us costumers. Was a bad experience for me and my husband our first time and maybe last one \n\nI think the locals deserve more attention from the buffets and managers", "I don't know what the hell they are doing in their kitchen but I know it's not good.", "So many choices , not bad !\nBut the oyster r not so good.\n\n\u98df\u7269\u7684\u9078\u64c7\u883b\u591a\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u932f\uff0c\u4e0d\u904e\u7261\u8823\u5012\u662f\u4e0d\u600e\u9ebc\u6a23... \u5f88\u591a\u4eba\u6392\u968a\uff0c\u8981\u6709\u6392\u968a\u7684\u6e96\u5099\u3002", "After walking around Las Vegas for 5 hours, my family and I was starving.

There's barely any meat within the shell! The ramen and pho is decent, but didn't taste like I expected. There's only 2 sushi dishes that wasn't even appetizing! I only enjoyed the salmon skinned that's my last reason for giving this place a 2 star.\n\nThe porridge has no taste, the breads are too hard, and what made this place worse is that there's NO dessert.\n\nThe meat is alright, but unfortunately, not mouth watering. \n\nNow, oyster is my favorite dish I always get every buffet/restaurant I go to. The oyster (cooked and raw) disappointed me so badly that my appetite disappeared. It wasn't so terrible that I'd want to vomit, it was that the oyster didn't taste delicious. The texture was slippery and that's normal, but once I bit into the seafood, I pushed the dish away from me. Not my type of oyster for sure.\n\nAfter the oyster I didn't try the rest of the varieties of food. There is a lot, though. It ranges from Asian, Italian, Mexican, and American.\n\nI'm a picky eater who feels insulted when my culture's food isn't at my level of \"good,\" so if you like Caesar, I'm not trying to insult your opinion. I'm stating what I experienced.", "It's not worth the 60 dallors...maybe more about 40...\nAnyways I was soooo excited for the oysters til my dad and sister had it and they said it tasted off. Didn't look that great but hey, its a buffet ...had to try it..\nSo that was disappointing to hear. \n\nThey had Chinese,  Japanese, Salads, American,  Italian,  Mexican, a variety of meats, and of course the Seafood ..clams, crawfish, salmon, cocktail shrimp, oysters, stone crab claws and crab legs. \n\nDessert was okay tooo. .nothing too special. Food isn't terrible just didn't have a wow factor in my book.", "BUFFET SUCKS!\nWe were doing the Buffet of Buffets and there was an upcharge for this Buffet of $30 a person. We heard good things about the Buffet so we decided to pay it. It was not at all worth it. \nFirst of all, I'm a vegetarian and there was hardly any vegetarian options available.\nMy non-vegetarian boyfriend was not impressed either. He did not like the selection and the things they did have was not worth the price.\nThe food wasn't bad but for the high dollar amount, I would go to any other buffet in Vegas.", "Found something in my food it was gross it was Mushroom Truffle and had a big white piece of something in it!!! Food not very fresh sitting out a whole long time. Never coming here again! I definitely do not recommend try a different buffet. Dessert is the only thing pretty descent here.", "I ate here the first year it was open and it was awesome!  Totally worth the price of admission.  Lots of great options, fancy handmade desserts etc.  Went back March 2016 excited to go back and it lousy.  The food wasn't very good, most items were way over salted.  The fancy deserts had been replaced with boring cookie cutter deserts similar to what you would find in any Chinese buffet anywhere in America.  Where are the Mochi Balls?  Service was not very good.  I made the mistake of tipping at the register.  Server was pretty much non existent  after bringing out the drinks.  Never came by to get plates or check if we needed a refill.  I cannot recommend this place going forward.  I realize sometimes you will have a bad experience eating out.  That is understood but when you drop almost $200 for two people everything should be on point.  It was not.", "I've been coming to this buffet once a every 3 month past 3yrs and this time it was very dispointing.  We went in around 4pm right after lunch and all the food was soooooooooo dried.  Sushi, Chinese foods, bbq section...most of the food was dried and it wasn't worth paying almost60 bucks for that food. Ill never go back again ever.", "I love buffets. I love varieties of food, how much you could eat and pretty much no waiting for food. The bad thing about it, it's gets kinda messy with people being dirty, food isn't fresh, waiting in line to get into the buffet and overeating. Bachanal isn't a bad buffet but i think it's overpriced. They do have other items that other buffets might not have but charging almost 70 dollars not including tip is outrageous. With those prices I rather go to a nicer restaurant. Wait here is also ridiculous. I heard people wait 2-3 hours to eat here. They don't even have a caeser palace hotel guest line. I tried this buffet once and might try it again but I wouldn't recommend it with other options on the Vegas strip", "Brought our friends while they visit us. We always brought friends here while they visit us. This price for this buffet is increasing but quality is getting worse and worse. It's not worth at all.", "Very disappointed. \nAll foods were way too salty, not so fresh, and the service was slow.", "Vegetarians beware: this is an incredibly poor deal for non-carnivores/pescatarians. \n\nMy boyfriend (a seafood lover) and I came here on a whim for our last meal in Vegas before heading to the airport. We figured a buffet of this size would surely have veggie-friendly options. Wrong.\n\nFirst off, the service is terrible. Everyone working here seems so unhappy, which was sad to see and it definitely influenced the atmosphere. We didn't see our waitress for the first 30 minutes after being seated, but luckily fresh juices are available next to the Mexican food. She was pretty much M.I.A. the entire time we dined and dirty dishes weren't cleared. \n\nAs for the food itself, labeling is very poor and it's difficult to get the attention of anyone behind the counter to inquire about whether items are veggie-friendly. When I asked for veggie tacos at the Mexican station, there was an incredible amount of cross-contamination since the area where meat had just been cooked was used for the rice/veggie combo. Nothing else was memorable (other than strawberry-balsamic gelato), so check out photos if you really want to see documentation of this depressing meals \n\nMy boyfriend was so happy with the seafood, but was so sad to see my dishes because he was shocked by how few options there were for me. We had just gone to Wicked Spoon the day prior and had an incredible time, so neither of us decided this visit to an equally famous buffet to be such a waste.", "No freaking way was this worth the money. We even had a hook up and essentially didn't have to wait at all. I think we were charged more because of our large party. We paid $70 a person. I wanted to eat some steaks but got full so fast. I had to wait in line forever at the taco station because the guy manning the grill was a gang banger and gave no fucks about the line, customer service or his job in general. I was irritated as hell I got talked into this place. Unless you can eat 10 pounds of crab or 10 pounds of steak there is no way you are getting your monies worth.", "Came here with high expectations after reading the reviews.  I've been to many buffets all over the world, and I must say that the buffet here is mediocre at best.  It is quite pricey (almost 140 dollars for 2 people including 15% tip).  There is a large selection, including a seafood section, western-style meats section, chinese food section, sushi section, and a taco station.  There is also a wide selection of desserts.  I ate quite a bit of seafood - crab legs, oysters, shrimp.  They were average and nothing to shout about - oysters were not very fresh.  I was impressed that they had a roasted suckling pig - however, it was a let down as the skin was soggy and not crispy at all.  The rest of the food was ok, but the worst was probably the sushi - rice was not cooked properly.  \n\nAll in all, a less than stellar experience with a large selection of food (though i've seen more selections in other buffets in other countries), with mediocre to average food quality.", "$50+ for mediocre food and not so great service. Not one item tasted great. The oysters were a little sketchy.", "This one star review is for the Bacchanal's terrible/undefined pricing policy. The food was decent, but I'm too irritated by what we were charged to comment. I came in on a Monday at 9:45am with my family and in-laws. 9:45am on a Monday. Clearly breakfast time. The person who rang us up charged us for weekday brunch (38.99). When I questioned why we were being charged for weekday brunch instead of breakfast, she said it was because we could potentially stay until lunch items were brought out. Huh?! What is the point of denoting very clear breakfast, lunch and dinner times on your website, only to ignore those entirely and charge based on potential length of stay. This was ridiculous. \n\n[Note: At time of our visit there was nothing indicating weekday brunch was even a thing. Caesar's website has since been updated to state that weekday brunch is from 7:30am to 11am, but at the same time breakfast is listed as 7:30am to 11am. Confusing much?] If we were there at 9:45 on a Monday and were charged for brunch, who gets charged breakfast prices? Only those arriving before 9am? Before 8am? Whomever the Bacchanal employees choose? Nobody? \n\nAlso, we left our table at 11am, just as lunch was being brought out. So no, Bacchanal, your fear that we would enjoy breakfast and lunch (oh no!) wasn't even realized. \n\nOverall, very disappointed with this experience.", "Long line!! Topped up 25 bucks total for one person for so called express line but not so express at all still kept us waiting. Food was okay nothing special.", "Food is different and better than my expectations.  But I hate the wait that is always long.   A lot of different desert. King crab is a must here.", "The food was nasty, and the price too expensive. Definitely not worthy of the hype and wait. The clams were sandy, the crawfish were dry (like they were frozen) or the meat was black like they were dead!!, the orange juice was grocery store quality, the street tacos lacked salt, the pineapple was sour, the deserts were nasty and they only have Pepsi products for soda. Need I say more??? \n\nTry wicked spoon. Much better in my opinion.", "I really really wanted to like this place but unfortunately, it got overhyped for me. The line was insanely long but that was to be expected for 12:30pm on a Saturday. We paid the extra $25/person for express which allows you to skip the entire line. This also included the bottomless mimosas which was a nice touch. My bf really wanted King crab but unfortunately, they only has snow and stone crab. I called ahead of time but guess I should've specified. I was really looking forward to fresh oysters but they didn't have any. Guess it's a dinner only thing? Some items were better than others, but what stood out was the prime rib. It was painfully dry! I was so disappointed! The brisket had more juice to it. I did like the desserts and how they have a crepe station. We both agree that we like Wicked Spoon better because we feel like that have better quality but slightly less options. After all of this, the worst part of this experience is that I got FOOD POISONING! I've only had that once in my 26yrs of being alive! My bf was ok. We couldn't pin point what it was from but the only items that I had that he didn't was the mimosa and shrimp cocktail. After eating, my stomach felt weird but I thought it was just from me eating more than what I usually eat. I just felt weird the rest of the day but it was a terrible night for me. Waking up every 30min to throw up! My bf was really shocked and has never seen me that sick. What bums be out is that I wasn't able to to anything the next day (which is today) and put a damper on our trip. I was hoping to have a nice time in Vegas before I start my new job tomorrow but sadly, I'm spending it sick in bed (and the bathroom, yuck!) Sorry to say, but I will not be returning to Bacchanal :(", "Rosemaria working in the front provided terrible customer service. Not did she look miserable the entire time, she gave our party (platinum members) attitude. We gave her our ticket and waited to be seated and she lost our ticket momentarily ... Making us wait even longer. While we waited about 6-7 parties seated in front of us. Terrible! The food is good otherwise.", "We tried this buffet last night and I would probably have given 5 stars but the cooks behind the counters at the Italian and Asian buffet were very unfriendly. Good and friendly service can make a huge difference when you're dining at a restaurant, especially a pricey one like this. The guy cooking the crab legs looked miserable and didn't even say hello when greeted. The older Asian man at the noodle soup station was downright rude/disrespectful. While he was waiting for the noodles to finish boiling for a customer I had a quick question regarding the sushi. He looked at me while he was waiting and as I opened my mouth to ask a question he immediately bent his head and looked away. I waited until he was done serving the noodles 2-3 minutes later and then he finally looked back at me, rolled his eyes and asked what I wanted. I paused, looked at him and said never mind. I was truly a bit disgusted with his rude demeanor and walked away.", "Dined here on a Monday at 8 p.m. It took an hour to get to the cashier, and on top of that the cashier told me I was not allowed in because of my attire (I wore a romper with a plunge neck line) come on man it was 115 degrees outside! Let me eat! So i spoke to the manager and she said I was ok. \n\nThem waited another 25 minutes to get a table and was told we only have 30 minutes to eat. \n\nThe line for the seafood was horrible and unorganized. People were coming in and out of the line trying to get food and would cut the line not knowing everyone has been standing in line to get some crappy snow crab legs. \n\n\nSnow crab legs are cut in half and sitting in an iced bath water which made the meat soggy and tasteless. Stone crab claws were hard and the meat stuck to the shell. All the other foods is whatever. \n\nWaste of time and money. Never returning.", "I always laugh at people who obviously know zero about restaurants and food post reviews.\nFor people who say this buffet is to expensive, you're wrong, the ingredients the chef is using are very expensive. Try costing out the carving station alone. \nHave been a chef and general manager for over 35 years and these guys do an exceptional job. If you feel it's too much money you have 2 feet be a big boy or girl and don't eat there, old town has plenty of cheap buffets for you folks.\nAnd guess what you can ask to see the food before you enter, If you are a vegan check it out before you go. I just get so tired of listening to people whine about how it wasent this and it was not that, people grow up its a buffet, I have dropped a thousand dollars for dinner before that's when I become upset when everything is not perfect, not for friggin 50 buck buffet. \nHave never had a bad meal here, and the staff.while not outstanding was quite good.", "Our waiter seems to be refusing to serve us. Ive had to ask for water 3 times before he finally brought some over.. never gave us a straw.. had to wait 3 more trips before we got a straw. Worst service ever. Woukd have been better served at a cheap buffet. Save your 100 bucks!", "Worse buffet I ever had in Vegas. Got so hype up because the high review on Yelp. super disappointed!", "Servers are nice, and the atmosphere was beautiful. However this is RIDICULOUSLY expensive for what you get. Most of the food that should've been hot was ice cold, gross. I wouldn't be writing this bad review if it was a couple of things that had been sitting there but it was mostly everything. Major bummer we walked out feeling robbed.", "Honestly, I brought my parents there. Waiting for 4hours and finally got in. However, most of foods are cold and salty. Lack of choices to eat. Compare with other buffet and price, I was Disappointed. Unreasonable price.", "One of the worst buffets I've had in Vegas. Nothing was flavorful or prepared with care. Would not recommend at anytime to anyone. I'm so disappointed and it really felt like a waste of money.", "Waste the time and money ! We went there with a lot of hope but the food and service turned out to be very disappointing, the environment looks very cheap and noisy, with the same money we should be able to get much better food and service else where. No next time.", "Pros: luxury feeling\nCons: dish smells yucky, compare to price the foods are cheap and taste awful, they just have  inexpensive foods and price looks like they have something", "This is most definitely not worth the wait.   We put our name in at 6.    We didn't get seated till nine.\nThe food is of poor quality except for the prime rib and crab.    They are the skinnier kind of crab.\n\nMany of the food were laid out sloppily.    The Asian food station had roast suckling pig cut up in pieces, but They were just poured in a heaping pile onto a flat service.    You couldn't see the nice crispy skin.   Even the meat station, you see a variety of meats together.  Really sloppy presentation.  \n\nIf you are one who hasn't had good food much or been to nice place to eat,  you may like it. But not if you've been around.\n\nWe paid $150.00 for two for mediocre food and waited three hours to be seated.\n\nI regret coming here.    What a lie!   They say it's the best buffet in the world.  I doubt it's the best in Vegas.", "I would give negative stars if I could for this ridiculously over priced buffet. The food here is cheap and badly prepared. Their so called fresh oysters are stale and smell, ribs are so tough and have no flavor at all. Fried rice is worse than Panda Express, clam chowder soup is very watery and salty, and there is barely any clam in it.  It is almost impossible to make pizza taste bad, but somehow they managed to make it happen. The dessert tastes like chemicals and is overly sweetened. For $80 per person, they only give you the cheapest fruits in the market. No blueberries or peaches. It is summer now! Seriously? I will never go back again.", "Went there for dinner 7/3/16. Absolutely the worst buffet experience in years. Total waste of time and money! 2 hours in line. Had to pay $86 \"upgrade\" fee for my wife and I on top of the Buffet of Buffets Pass. For what??? Yes the shrimps were large and good. Crepes were not bad. NOTHING ELSE! Clam chowder was nothing more than a salty water. The beef had more fat than meat. Basically there was no food to choose from. Not even a regular salad bar that you can get everywhere else. No sushi, no nothing. My last time going there.", "Got charged $151.39 for two. That's fine.\nThe sliced beef rib was very hard to chew..\nThe crab leg was spoiled and smells very bad.\nSea bass were not fresh at all! Very hard tastes like pork!\nGot seated around 08:40pm (they close at 10:00)\nMany dishes were not available. \nShort handed, waiting for a long time for someone to come and get some drinks.", "I'm not sure if it was because it was July 4th weekend, but the value was just not there at all. It cost us $88 a person after tax+tip and a 45 minute wait to get in. Waitress / Waiter service was good.\n\nAfter you get in, more lines (plural) to get food! All stations except the cheap Chinese food station had long lines.\n\nThe good food:\n-Bone marrow bones (hard to mess up)\n-Rib roast (hard to mess up)\n-Snow Crab legs and butter (hard to mess up)\n-Dessert - crepes, gelato, macarons (super long lines for dessert)\n-Pho (waited ~10 minutes for pho OR ramen, but the noodle soup guy was taking his sweet time with everything, so I just tried my friend's pho)\n\nThe okay food:\n-Lobster rolls (the only lobster present in the buffet are the shreds in these buns)\n\nThe bad food:\n-Sushi (may have been spoiled; REALLY BAD fish for an $88 buffet and kinda ruined my appetite)\n\nI would have been satisfied if I paid $40-50 total for this buffet. At this price point (most I've ever paid pp for a meal), I was very disappointed with the quality and variety.", "Very disappointed! For the price of $55 per person. Crab legs were so salty and shrimps weren't fresh at all. I will not return to this over priced buffet!\nAlso the waiting time was ridiculous long, not worthy the time or the money.", "Absolutely terrible, low class, and rude customer service! The staff/hostesses at the entrance were lost and confused and took forever to seat us, then as we exit they disrespected us regarding a minor misunderstanding. We are Vegas locals for 16 years and this has been the absolute worst experience we have had. My family and I are very offended by their unprofessional attitude. We paid $50 per person for terrible service and mediocre food. There are definitely much better buffets in town, especially for seafood lovers. We will never return to this one!", "Sadly disappointing, wasted my money. Fair to poor considering cost and hype. We visited similar businesses on the strip, all of which out performed this one. Don't waste your money here.", "I was looking for nice buffet place on Vegas. Having seen the high rating after so many reviews I was really looking forward to this place. That's why we waited for more than an hour to get in. Needless to say I was disappointed. In general, I pay a lot attention on the ingredients restaurants use. This place definitely did not use fresh ingredients. Their seafood was not fresh, the rest of meat options were so-so,and the fruits were hard to swallow! No matter how many sauces you put in, you can't be a good restaurant if you don't use good and fresh ingredients!", "This buffet has been rated the top buffet for all of Vegas mistakenly. Having tried the top 10 and this being last on my list, it is not worth the money nor should it be in the top 5. The stations served warm food consistently across them all. The flavor was lacking as well as the quality. The wicked spoon rates number 2 and really should be the top one and the bachannal should be 6. I think because the number of stations, 9 in all, people rate this #1 and and not because of their quality. Spend your money elsewhere either at a high end restaurant or at least the wicked spoon if a buffet is a must.", "Quantity vs Quality. The presentation and number of options are impressive. But it all goes downhill after that. Most food is bland and a lot of mush. Very generic. A special mention for the Asian section, it's just terrible. The sushi is bad and I actually had to spit out the noodles. I don't understand how this place has such a good reputation... Maybe I caught them on a bad day.", "Den mest SINDSSYGE buffet jeg nogensinde har spist p\u00e5!? Vi var seks mennesker, og fordi vi var s\u00e5 mange kom vi i en seperat k\u00f8, som ikke var s\u00e6rlig lang - vi ventede derfor ikke l\u00e6nge p\u00e5 at f\u00e5 et bord. Man betaler f\u00f8r man g\u00e5r ind (ca $40/person, som inkluderer alt mad og drikkevarer). Prisen er m\u00e5ske lidt dyr ift hvad ellers ville betale for at g\u00e5 ud og spise et almindeligt sted (m\u00e5ske mere ala $10-15/person, men dette er virkelig pengene v\u00e6rd!!). Vi spiste kl 11-13 (man kan v\u00e6re der 2 timer), og spiste derfor n\u00e6rmest for hele dagen i \u00e9t m\u00e5ltid. Buffeten bugner af alt hvad hjertet beg\u00e6rer; over 300 forskellige retter, 70 dessert-items (inkl en masse sukkerfrie muligheder), 9 forskellige sp\u00e6ndende gelatos, friskpressede juicer, hummer og skaldyr, sushi, pizza, br\u00f8d, osv osv osv. Det er ikke bare en ordin\u00e6r buffet, hvor det er kvantitet over kvalitet - NEJ - her var der virkelig kvalitet over maden, som var serveret i sm\u00e5 portioner p\u00e5 meget indbydende m\u00e5der. Tjenerne var gode til at rydde af bordet, n\u00e5r man var f\u00e6rdig med sin tallerken, og serverede kaffe n\u00e5r man spurgte.\nDet er en god ide at komme lige mellem morgenmad og frokost ligesom vi gjorde, da man p\u00e5 den m\u00e5de f\u00f8rst f\u00e5r pr\u00f8vet deres morgenbuffet, og n\u00e5r det s\u00e5 bliver frokosttid, kan man g\u00e5 i krig med frokostbuffeten.\nDette sted kan jeg virkelig anbefale - ligger i Cesar's Palace, hvilket ogs\u00e5 er et flot hotel.", "Bacchanal seemed overhyped to me, though a couple of my friends love it. The cost was about $65 per person including tax and tip. Wait times were long, though the line for large groups (over 6 people) seems to move more quickly.\n\nBacchanal offers a really large selection of food. Inside you will find a raw bar, soup station, carving station, large dessert island with gelato, made-to-order tacos, made-to-order ramen and udon, dim sum, stir fry, sushi, congee, pasta, salad, cheese, breakfast food, and more. \n\nDespite the large selection, I didn't try anything that made me want seconds and eventually began to circle around listlessly and unable to find things I wanted to try.\n\nI was really looking forward to the raw bar, but I was disappointed by the flavors. The crab legs were a bit salty. The crab claws just didn't taste right and were either flavorless or slightly bitter. \n\nA few things I tried were bad, such as the incredibly bitter ginseng chicken soup and seafood pasta that was cold on the inside. Everything else was just okay. \n\nService was lacking. It was hard to flag someone down. I waited 10min just to get a crab cracker. Dishes were cleared infrequently. My utensils were taken away although I'd set them aside, and I couldn't get find someone to get me a replacement set.\n\nIf I had come here too hungry to be picky, I would have enjoyed the experience more. That being said, I think there are better meals to be had on the strip for less, especially if you're not into buffets.", "I was disappointed in how expensive the buffet was and how mediocre the food was.  I do not mind paying money for delicious food but this buffet was probably one of the worst I've eaten at.  Everything tastes the same and there were wayyyyy too many bland foods.  It seems like they tried to hard to be fancy but chefs don't typically specialize in many things so their attempts fell way short.  The buffets as Monte Carlo, Mirage, and even Luxor have better food (which is SHOCKING)!  They do more home style foods that are not extravagant and they nail it.  I would spend your money elsewhere because it's not worth it.  Oh!  And our server only filled our drinks once without us having to ask.  It was hot and I was parched but she walked by several times and didn't even notice that our drinks were drained of even ice."]
